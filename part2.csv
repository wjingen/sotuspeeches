Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. And they've done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.

It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable -– that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run, and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people.

Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.

One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted -– immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.

But the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder.

This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades –- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.

So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.

For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.

So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.

You know what else they share. They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, ""We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.""


It's because of this spirit -– this great decency and great strength -– that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. (Applause.) Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength. (Applause.)
And tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.

It begins with our economy.

Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it — (applause.) I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal. (Laughter.)

But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular -– I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.

So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks. (Applause.) Most but not all.

To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. (Applause.) Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need. (Applause.)

Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed.

That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts.

Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. (Applause.) We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. (Applause.)

I thought I'd get some applause on that one. (Laughter and applause.)


As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person. Not a single dime. (Applause.)

Because of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. (Applause.) Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders. (Applause.) And we're on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year.

The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act. (Applause.) That's right -– the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. (Applause.) Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.

There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.

But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight. (Applause.)

Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. (Applause.) But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.

We should start where most new jobs do –- in small businesses, companies that begin when — (applause) — companies that begin when an entrepreneur — when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small businessowners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit.

So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. (Applause.) I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit
-– one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. (Applause.) While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. (Applause.)


Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. (Applause.) From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.

Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. (Applause.) There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services, and information. (Applause.)

We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities — (applause) — and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. (Applause.) And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)

Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. (Applause.) As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. (Applause.) They will. (Applause.) People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay. (Applause.)

But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the seven million jobs that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.

We can't afford another so-called economic ""expansion"" like the one from the last decade –- what some call the ""lost decade"" -– where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.

From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while.

For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait. How long should America put its future on hold. (Applause.)


You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China is not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany is not waiting. India is not waiting. These nations — they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America. (Applause.)

As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.

Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.

We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. (Applause.) We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.

Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. (Applause.) And the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let them win this fight. (Applause.) And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right. (Applause.)

Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history -– (applause) — an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy -– in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.

But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. (Applause.) It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. (Applause.) It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. (Applause.) And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. (Applause.)

I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. (Applause.) And this year I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. (Applause.)


I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But here's the thing — even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future -– because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation. (Applause.)

Third, we need to export more of our goods. (Applause.) Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. (Applause.) So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. (Applause.) To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security. (Applause.)

We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. (Applause.) But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. (Applause.) And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia. (Applause.)

Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. (Applause.)

Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform — reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education. (Applause.) And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.

When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states. Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families. (Applause.)

To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. (Applause.) Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants. (Applause.) And let's tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college. (Applause.)

And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs -– (applause) — because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.


Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families. That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment –- their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.

This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. (Applause.) And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform. (Applause.) Yes, we do. (Applause.)

Now, let's clear a few things up. (Laughter.) I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. (Laughter.) I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who've been denied coverage; families –- even those with insurance -– who are just one illness away from financial ruin.

After nearly a century of trying — Democratic administrations, Republican administrations — we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.

And by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. (Applause.) Thank you. She gets embarrassed. (Laughter.)

Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades. (Applause.)

Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, ""What's in it for me.""


But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber. (Applause.)

So, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. (Applause.) Let me know. Let me know. (Applause.) I'm eager to see it.

Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. (Applause.) Let's get it done. Let's get it done. (Applause.)

Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight.

At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. (Applause.) By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door. (Laughter and applause.)

Now — just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact.

I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same. (Applause.) So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.

Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. (Applause.) Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will. (Applause.)


We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it. (Applause.)

Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. (Applause.) This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.

Now, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. (Applause.) And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s. (Applause.)

Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree — which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year — (laughter) — when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works. (Laughter and applause.) But understand –- understand if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.

From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument -– that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The problem is that's what we did for eight years. (Applause.) That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.

Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense. (Laughter.) A novel concept.

To do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust -– deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue — to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; to give our people the government they deserve. (Applause.)


That's what I came to Washington to do. That's why -– for the first time in history –- my administration posts on our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on federal boards and commissions.

But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.

With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections. (Applause.) I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. (Applause.) They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.

I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform. Applause.) Democrats and Republicans. (Applause.) Democrats and Republicans. You've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change. But restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online. (Applause.) Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote, so that the American people can see how their money is being spent. (Applause.)

Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naïve. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony — (laughter) — and some post-partisan era. I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.

But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side -– a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation of — (applause) — I'm speaking to both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators. (Applause.)

Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.


So, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.

To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills. (Applause.) And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town — a supermajority — then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well. (Applause.) Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. (Applause.) So let's show the American people that we can do it together. (Applause.)

This week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait. (Laughter.)

Throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future — for America and for the world. (Applause.)

That's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we've renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed — far more than in 2008.

And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home. (Applause.) We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans — men and women alike. (Applause.) We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments, and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead. But I am absolutely confident we will succeed.

As we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August. (Applause.) We will support the Iraqi government — we will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home. (Applause.)


Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform — in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world –- they have to know that we — that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home. (Applause.) That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades — last year. (Applause.) That's why we're building a 21st century VA. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families. (Applause.)

Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people -– the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. (Applause.) And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C. behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists. (Applause.)

Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions –- sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. That's why the international community is more united, and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise. (Applause.)

That's the leadership that we are providing –- engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease -– a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.

As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right. That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. (Applause.) That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan; why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity. (Applause.) Always. (Applause.)


Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.

We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. (Applause.) We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate. (Applause.) This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. (Applause.) It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)

We're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws -– so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work. (Applause.) And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system -– to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation. (Applause.)

In the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America — values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit. These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by; business values or labor values. They're American values.

Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -– our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government –- still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.

No wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment.


I campaigned on the promise of change –- change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change –- or that I can deliver it.

But remember this –- I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.

Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next generation.

But I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.

Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year. And what keeps me going -– what keeps me fighting -– is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on.

It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company, ""None of us,"" he said, ""…are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.""

It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, ""We are strong. We are resilient. We are American.""

It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti.

And it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of ""U.S.A.. U.S.A.. U.S.A."" when another life was saved.

The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. (Applause.) Let's seize this moment — to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more. (Applause.)

Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)",43698,"['Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n\n\nOur Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our union', ' For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty', "" They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility"", "" And they've done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle"", ""\n\nIt's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable -– that America was always destined to succeed"", ' But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run, and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt', ' When the market crashed on Black Tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain', ' These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union', ' And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people', '\n\nAgain, we are tested', "" And again, we must answer history's call"", '\n\nOne year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt', ' Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression', ' So we acted -– immediately and aggressively', ' And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed', '\n\nBut the devastation remains', ' One in 10 Americans still cannot find work', ' Many businesses have shuttered', ' Home values have declined', ' Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard', "" And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder"", ""\n\nThis recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades –- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college"", '\n\nSo I know the anxieties that are out there right now', "" They're not new"", ' These struggles are the reason I ran for President', "" These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois"", ' I hear about them in the letters that I read each night', ' The toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work', '\n\nFor these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough', ' Some are frustrated; some are angry', "" They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems"", "" They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness"", "" They know we can't afford it"", ' Not now', '\n\nSo we face big and difficult challenges', ' And what the American people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics', ' For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same', ' The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life', '\n\nYou know what else they share', ' They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity', ' After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school', "" They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors"", ' One woman wrote to me and said, ""We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged', '""\n\n\nIt\'s because of this spirit -– this great decency and great strength -– that I have never been more hopeful about America\'s future than I am tonight', ' (Applause', ') Despite our hardships, our union is strong', ' We do not give up', ' We do not quit', ' We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit', "" In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength"", ' (Applause', "")\nAnd tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise"", '\n\nIt begins with our economy', '\n\nOur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', ' It was not easy to do', "" And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout"", ' I hated it — (applause', ') I hated it', ' You hated it', ' It was about as popular as a root canal', ' (Laughter', "")\n\nBut when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular -– I would do what was necessary"", ' And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today', ' More businesses would certainly have closed', ' More homes would have surely been lost', ""\n\nSo I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program"", ' And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable', "" And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks"", ' (Applause', ') Most but not all', ""\n\nTo recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks"", ' (Applause', "") Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea"", ' But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need', ' (Applause', ')\n\nNow, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed', ""\n\nThat's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts"", '\n\nNow, let me repeat: We cut taxes', ' We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families', ' (Applause', ') We cut taxes for small businesses', ' We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers', ' We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children', ' We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college', ' (Applause', "")\n\nI thought I'd get some applause on that one"", ' (Laughter and applause', ')\n\n\nAs a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers', "" And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person"", ' Not a single dime', ' (Applause', ')\n\nBecause of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed', ' (Applause', ') Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers', ' Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders', ' (Applause', "") And we're on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year"", '\n\nThe plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act', ' (Applause', "") That's right -– the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill"", ' (Applause', ') Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster', "" But you don't have to take their word for it"", ' Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act', ' Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created', "" Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all"", '\n\nThere are stories like this all across America', ' And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again', ' Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value', ' Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again', '\n\nBut I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response', "" That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight"", ' (Applause', "")\n\nNow, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses"", ' (Applause', ') But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers', ""\n\nWe should start where most new jobs do –- in small businesses, companies that begin when — (applause) — companies that begin when an entrepreneur — when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss"", "" Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and they're ready to grow"", "" But when you talk to small businessowners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies"", ' Financing remains difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit', ""\n\nSo tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat"", ' (Applause', "") I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit\n-– one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages"", ' (Applause', "") While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment"", ' (Applause', ')\n\n\nNext, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow', ' (Applause', ') From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete', "" There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products"", ""\n\nTomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act"", ' (Applause', "") There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services, and information"", ' (Applause', ')\n\nWe should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities — (applause) — and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which supports clean energy jobs', ' (Applause', ') And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America', ' (Applause', ')\n\nNow, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps', ' (Applause', ') As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will', ' (Applause', ') They will', ' (Applause', ') People are out of work', "" They're hurting"", ' They need our help', ' And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay', ' (Applause', "")\n\nBut the truth is, these steps won't make up for the seven million jobs that we've lost over the last two years"", "" The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years"", '\n\nWe can\'t afford another so-called economic ""expansion"" like the one from the last decade –- what some call the ""lost decade"" -– where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation', ""\n\nFrom the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious"", "" I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while"", '\n\nFor those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait', ' How long should America put its future on hold', ' (Applause', ')\n\n\nYou see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse', ' Meanwhile, China is not waiting to revamp its economy', ' Germany is not waiting', ' India is not waiting', "" These nations — they're not standing still"", "" These nations aren't playing for second place"", "" They're putting more emphasis on math and science"", "" They're rebuilding their infrastructure"", "" They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs"", ' Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America', ' (Applause', "")\n\nAs hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth"", '\n\nNow, one place to start is serious financial reform', ' Look, I am not interested in punishing banks', "" I'm interested in protecting our economy"", ' A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs', ' It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes', ' But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy', '\n\nWe need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions', ' (Applause', "") We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy"", '\n\nNow, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes', ' (Applause', ') And the lobbyists are trying to kill it', ' But we cannot let them win this fight', ' (Applause', ') And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right', "" We've got to get it right"", ' (Applause', ')\n\nNext, we need to encourage American innovation', "" Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history -– (applause) — an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched"", ' And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy', "" You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy -– in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels"", '\n\nBut to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives', ' And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country', ' (Applause', ') It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development', ' (Applause', ') It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies', ' (Applause', ') And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America', ' (Applause', ')\n\nI am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year', ' (Applause', "") And this year I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate"", ' (Applause', ')\n\n\nI know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy', ' I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change', "" But here's the thing — even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future -– because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy"", ' And America must be that nation', ' (Applause', ')\n\nThird, we need to export more of our goods', ' (Applause', ') Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America', ' (Applause', ') So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America', ' (Applause', "") To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security"", ' (Applause', ')\n\nWe have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are', ' If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores', ' (Applause', ') But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules', ' (Applause', "") And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia"", ' (Applause', ')\n\nFourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people', ' (Applause', "")\n\nNow, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools"", ' And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success', ' Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform — reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city', ' In the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education', ' (Applause', ') And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential', '\n\nWhen we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states', ' Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job', "" That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families"", ' (Applause', ')\n\nTo make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans', ' (Applause', "") Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants"", ' (Applause', "") And let's tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college"", ' (Applause', "")\n\nAnd by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs -– (applause) — because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem"", '\n\n\nNow, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class', "" That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families"", "" That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg"", "" That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment –- their home"", ' The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments', '\n\nThis year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages', ' (Applause', ') And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform', ' (Applause', ') Yes, we do', ' (Applause', "")\n\nNow, let's clear a few things up"", ' (Laughter', "") I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt"", "" And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics"", ' (Laughter', "") I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who've been denied coverage; families –- even those with insurance -– who are just one illness away from financial ruin"", '\n\nAfter nearly a century of trying — Democratic administrations, Republican administrations — we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans', "" The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry"", ' It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market', ' It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care', '\n\nAnd by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier', ' (Applause', ') Thank you', ' She gets embarrassed', ' (Laughter', ')\n\nOur approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan', ' It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses', ' And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades', ' (Applause', ')\n\nStill, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became', ' I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people', ' And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, ""What\'s in it for me', '""\n\n\nBut I also know this problem is not going away', "" By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance"", ' Millions will lose it this year', ' Our deficit will grow', ' Premiums will go up', ' Patients will be denied the care they need', ' Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether', ' I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber', ' (Applause', "")\n\nSo, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed"", "" There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo"", ' But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know', ' (Applause', ') Let me know', ' Let me know', ' (Applause', "") I'm eager to see it"", ""\n\nHere's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform"", ' Not now', ' Not when we are so close', ' Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people', ' (Applause', "") Let's get it done"", "" Let's get it done"", ' (Applause', "")\n\nNow, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves"", "" It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing"", ' So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight', '\n\nAt the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion', ' (Applause', ') By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade', ' Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program', ' On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget', ' All this was before I walked in the door', ' (Laughter and applause', ')\n\nNow — just stating the facts', ' Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit', ' But we took office amid a crisis', ' And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt', ' That, too, is a fact', ""\n\nI'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do"", ' But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions', ' The federal government should do the same', ' (Applause', "") So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year"", '\n\nStarting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years', ' (Applause', ') Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected', ' But all other discretionary government programs will', "" Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't"", ' And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will', ' (Applause', "")\n\n\nWe will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work"", "" We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year"", "" To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts"", ' But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year', "" We just can't afford it"", ' (Applause', "")\n\nNow, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office"", ' More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security

blocked a bill that would have created this commission', "" So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of

1,speeches\obama2011.txt,obama,2011,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:

Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner.  (Applause.)  And as we mark this occasion, we’re also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague -- and our friend -– Gabby Giffords.  (Applause.)

It’s no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years.  The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs.  And that’s a good thing.  That’s what a robust democracy demands.  That’s what helps set us apart as a nation.

But there’s a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -– something more consequential than party or political preference.

We are part of the American family.  We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.

That, too, is what sets us apart as a nation.  (Applause.)

Now, by itself, this simple recognition won’t usher in a new era of cooperation.  What comes of this moment is up to us.  What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow.  (Applause.)

I believe we can.  And I believe we must.  That’s what the people who sent us here expect of us.  With their votes, they’ve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties.  New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans.  We will move forward together, or not at all -– for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics.

At stake right now is not who wins the next election -– after all, we just had an election.  At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else.  It’s whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded.  It’s whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world.

We are poised for progress.  Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back.  Corporate profits are up.  The economy is growing again.

But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone.  We measure progress by the success of our people.  By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer.  By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise.  By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.

That’s the project the American people want us to work on. Together.  (Applause.)

We did that in December.  Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans’ paychecks are a little bigger today.  Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.  And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.

But we have to do more.  These steps we’ve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we’ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.

Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.  You didn’t always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors.  If you worked hard, chances are you’d have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion.  Maybe you’d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.

That world has changed.  And for many, the change has been painful.  I’ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I’ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who’ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -– proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.

They’re right.  The rules have changed.  In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business.  Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100.  Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there’s an Internet connection.

Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science.  They’re investing in research and new technologies.  Just recently, China became the home to the world’s largest private solar research facility, and the world’s fastest computer.

So, yes, the world has changed.  The competition for jobs is real.  But this shouldn’t discourage us.  It should challenge us. Remember -– for all the hits we’ve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world.  (Applause.)  No workers -- no workers are more productive than ours.  No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs.  We’re the home to the world’s best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth.

What’s more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea -– the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny.  That’s why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.  It’s why our students don’t just memorize equations, but answer questions like “What do you think of that idea.  What would you change about the world.  What do you want to be when you grow up.”

The future is ours to win.  But to get there, we can’t just stand still.  As Robert Kennedy told us, “The future is not a gift.  It is an achievement.”  Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat.  It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.

And now it’s our turn.  We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time.  We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.  (Applause.)  We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.  We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government.  That’s how our people will prosper.  That’s how we’ll win the future.  (Applause.)  And tonight, I’d like to talk about how we get there.
                           

 
The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.  None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from.  Thirty years ago, we couldn’t know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution.  What we can do -- what America does better than anyone else -- is spark the creativity and imagination of our people.  We’re the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook.  In America, innovation doesn’t just change our lives.  It is how we make our living.  (Applause.)

Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation.  But because it’s not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need.  That’s what planted the seeds for the Internet.  That’s what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.  Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs.

Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon.  The science wasn’t even there yet.  NASA didn’t exist.  But after investing in better research and education, we didn’t just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.

This is our generation’s Sputnik moment.  Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven’t seen since the height of the Space Race.  And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal.  We’ll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology -– (applause) -- an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.

Already, we’re seeing the promise of renewable energy.  Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company.  After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon.  But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard.  Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country.  In Robert’s words, “We reinvented ourselves.”

That’s what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves.  And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we’ve begun to reinvent our energy policy. We’re not just handing out money.  We’re issuing a challenge.  We’re telling America’s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we’ll fund the Apollo projects of our time.

At the California Institute of Technology, they’re developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars.  At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they’re using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities.  With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.  (Applause.)

We need to get behind this innovation.  And to help pay for it, I’m asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies.  (Applause.)  I don’t know if -- I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but they’re doing just fine on their own.  (Laughter.)  So instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s.

Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they’re selling.  So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal:  By 2035, 80 percent of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources.  (Applause.)

Some folks want wind and solar.  Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas.  To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.  (Applause.)

Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America’s success.  But if we want to win the future -– if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -– then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.

Think about it.  Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education.  And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school.  The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.  America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.  And so the question is whether all of us –- as citizens, and as parents –- are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.

That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities.  It’s family that first instills the love of learning in a child.  Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.  We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair.  (Applause.)  We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.

Our schools share this responsibility.  When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance.  But too many schools don’t meet this test. That’s why instead of just pouring money into a system that’s not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top.  To all 50 states, we said, “If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we’ll show you the money.”

Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.  For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning.  And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country.  And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that’s more flexible and focused on what’s best for our kids.  (Applause.)

You see, we know what’s possible from our children when reform isn’t just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities.  Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver.  Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs.  But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma.  Most will be the first in their families to go to college.  And after the first year of the school’s transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, “Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.”  (Applause.)  That’s what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country.

Let’s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom.  In South Korea, teachers are known as “nation builders.”  Here in America, it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect.  (Applause.)  We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.  (Applause.)  And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math.  (Applause.)

In fact, to every young person listening tonight who’s contemplating their career choice:  If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher.  Your country needs you.  (Applause.)

Of course, the education race doesn’t end with a high school diploma.  To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American.  (Applause.)  That’s why we’ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students.  (Applause.)  And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit –- worth $10,000 for four years of college.  It’s the right thing to do.  (Applause.)

Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today’s fast-changing economy, we’re also revitalizing America’s community colleges.  Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina.  Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town.  One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old.  And she told me she’s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too.  As Kathy said, “I hope it tells them to never give up.”

If we take these steps -– if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take –- we will reach the goal that I set two years ago:  By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.  (Applause.)

One last point about education.  Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens.  Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.  Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities.  But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us.  It makes no sense.

Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.  And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.  (Applause.)  I know that debate will be difficult.  I know it will take time.  But tonight, let’s agree to make that effort.  And let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation.  (Applause.)

The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America.  To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet.  (Applause.)

Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped.  South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do.  Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.  China is building faster trains and newer airports.  Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation’s infrastructure, they gave us a “D.”

We have to do better.  America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System.  The jobs created by these projects didn’t just come from laying down track or pavement.  They came from businesses that opened near a town’s new train station or the new off-ramp.

So over the last two years, we’ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry.  And tonight, I’m proposing that we redouble those efforts.  (Applause.)

We’ll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.  We’ll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what’s best for the economy, not politicians.

Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail.  (Applause.)  This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car.  For some trips, it will be faster than flying –- without the pat-down.  (Laughter and applause.)  As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.

Within the next five years, we’ll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans.  This isn’t just about -- (applause) -- this isn’t about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls.  It’s about connecting every part of America to the digital age.  It’s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world.  It’s about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.

All these investments -– in innovation, education, and infrastructure –- will make America a better place to do business and create jobs.  But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.

For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries.  Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all.  But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.  It makes no sense, and it has to change.  (Applause.)

So tonight, I’m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system.  Get rid of the loopholes.  Level the playing field.  And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years –- without adding to our deficit.  It can be done.  (Applause.)

To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home.  Already, our exports are up.  Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States.  And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs.  This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible.  (Applause.)

Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs.  That’s what we did with Korea, and that’s what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks.  (Applause.)

To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I’ve ordered a review of government regulations.  When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them.  (Applause.)  But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people.  (Applause.)  That’s what we’ve done in this country for more than a century.  It’s why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe.  It’s why we have speed limits and child labor laws.  It’s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis.  (Applause.)  And it’s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.  (Applause.)

Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.  (Laughter.)  So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.  If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you.  We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.  (Applause.)

What I’m not willing to do -- what I’m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.  (Applause.)

I’m not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered.  I’m not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees.  As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients’ -- parents’ coverage.  (Applause.)

So I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and let’s move forward.  (Applause.)

Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren’t buried under a mountain of debt.

We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.  And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people’s pockets.

But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in.  That is not sustainable.  Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means.  They deserve a government that does the same.

So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years.  (Applause.)  Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.

This freeze will require painful cuts.  Already, we’ve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years.  I’ve proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs.  The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.  (Applause.)

I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I’m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without.  But let’s make sure that we’re not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.  (Applause.)  And let’s make sure that what we’re cutting is really excess weight.  Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.  It may make you feel like you’re flying high at first, but it won’t take long before you feel the impact.  (Laughter.)

Now, most of the cuts and savings I’ve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget.  To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.  It won’t.  (Applause.)

The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.  I don’t agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress.  And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it –- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.  (Applause.)

This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.  The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.  Still, I’m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.  (Applause.)

To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.  (Applause.)  We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market.  (Applause.)

And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can’t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.  (Applause.)  Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.  It’s not a matter of punishing their success.  It’s about promoting America’s success.  (Applause.)

In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code.  (Applause.)  This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them.  (Applause.)

So now is the time to act.  Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress –- Democrats and Republicans -– to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done.  If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future.

Let me take this one step further.  We shouldn’t just give our people a government that’s more affordable.  We should give them a government that’s more competent and more efficient.  We can’t win the future with a government of the past.  (Applause.)

We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV.  There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports.  There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy.  Then there’s my favorite example:  The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they’re in saltwater.  (Laughter.)  I hear it gets even more complicated once they’re smoked.  (Laughter and applause.)

Now, we’ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste.  Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.  We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we’ll cut through red tape to get rid of more.  But we need to think bigger.  In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America.  I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote –- and we will push to get it passed.  (Applause.)

In the coming year, we’ll also work to rebuild people’s faith in the institution of government.  Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you’ll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history.  Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online.  And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren’t larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this:  If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.  I will veto it.  (Applause.)

The 21st century government that’s open and competent.  A government that lives within its means.  An economy that’s driven by new skills and new ideas.  Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation.  It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.

Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges.  No single wall separates East and West.  No one rival superpower is aligned against us.

And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion.  And America’s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity.  And because we’ve begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America’s standing has been restored.

Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high.  (Applause.)  American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed.  This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq.  America’s commitment has been kept.  The Iraq war is coming to an end.  (Applause.)

Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us.  Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we’re disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.  And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family.  (Applause.)    

We’ve also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad.  In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces.  Our purpose is clear:  By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.

Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency.  There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance.  But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.  This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead.  And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home.  (Applause.)

In Pakistan, al Qaeda’s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001.  Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield.  Their safe havens are shrinking.  And we’ve sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe:  We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you.  (Applause.)

American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.  Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed.  Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists.  (Applause.)

Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before.  And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.  (Applause.)

This is just a part of how we’re shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.  With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense.  We’ve reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India.

This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas.  Around the globe, we’re standing with those who take responsibility -– helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.

Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power -– it must also be the purpose behind it.  In south Sudan -– with our assistance -– the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war.  (Applause.)  Thousands lined up before dawn.  People danced in the streets.  One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him:  “This was a battlefield for most of my life,” he said.  “Now we want to be free.”  (Applause.)

And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator.  And tonight, let us be clear:  The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.  (Applause.)

We must never forget that the things we’ve struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere.  And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country.  (Applause.)

Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families.  Let us serve them as well as they’ve served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.

Our troops come from every corner of this country -– they’re black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American.  They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim.  And, yes, we know that some of them are gay.  Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love.  (Applause.)  And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC.  It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.  It is time to move forward as one nation.  (Applause.)

We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit –- none of this will be easy.  All of it will take time.  And it will be harder because we will argue about everything.  The costs.  The details.  The letter of every law.

Of course, some countries don’t have this problem.  If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed.  If they don’t want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn’t get written.

And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn’t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth.  (Applause.)

We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution.  We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try.  We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible.  No matter who you are.  No matter where you come from.

That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.  That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me.  (Laughter and applause.)  That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father’s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth.  (Applause.)

That dream -– that American Dream -– is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era.  It’s what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future.  And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.

Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology.  And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.

But Brandon thought his company could help.  And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B.  His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment.  And Brandon left for Chile.

Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep.  Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued.  (Applause.)  But because he didn’t want all of the attention, Brandon wasn’t there when the miners emerged.  He’d already gone back home, back to work on his next project.

And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, “We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.”  (Applause.)

We do big things.

From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream.  That’s how we win the future.

We’re a nation that says, “I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.”  “I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.”  “I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.”  “I’m not sure how we’ll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we’ll get there.  I know we will.”

We do big things.  (Applause.)

The idea of America endures.  Our destiny remains our choice.  And tonight, more than two centuries later, it’s because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.

Thank you.  God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)",41023,"['Mr', ' Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n\nTonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the

little bigger today', '  Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year', '  And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year', '\n\nBut we have to do more', '  These steps we’ve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we’ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making', '\n\nMany people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown', '  You didn’t always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors', '  If you worked hard, chances are you’d have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion', '  Maybe you’d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company', '\n\nThat world has changed', '  And for many, the change has been painful', '  I’ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets', ' I’ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who’ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -– proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game', '\n\nThey’re right', '  The rules have changed', '  In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business', '  Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100', '  Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there’s an Internet connection', '\n\nMeanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world', ' And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science', '  They’re investing in research and new technologies', '  Just recently, China became the home to the world’s largest private solar research facility, and the world’s fastest computer', '\n\nSo, yes, the world has changed', '  The competition for jobs is real', '  But this shouldn’t discourage us', '  It should challenge us', ' Remember -– for all the hits we’ve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers

now it’s our turn', '  We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time', '  We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world', '  (Applause', ')  We

innovation', '  None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from', '  Thirty years ago, we couldn’t know that something called the Internet

driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook', '  In America, innovation doesn’t just change our lives', '  It is how we make our living', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOur free enterprise system is what drives innovation', '  But because it’s not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need', '  That’s what planted the seeds for the Internet', '  That’s what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS', '  Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs', '\n\nHalf a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon', '  The science wasn’t even there yet', '  NASA didn’t exist', '  But after investing in better research and education, we didn’t just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs', '\n\nThis is our generation’s Sputnik moment', '  Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven’t seen since the height of the Space Race', '  And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal', '  We’ll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology -– (applause) -- an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people', '\n\nAlready, we’re seeing the promise of renewable energy', '  Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company', '  After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon', '  But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard', '  Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country', '  In Robert’s words, “We reinvented ourselves', '”\n\nThat’s what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves', '  And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we’ve begun to reinvent our energy policy', ' We’re not just handing out money', '  We’re issuing a challenge', '  We’re telling America’s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we’ll fund the Apollo projects of our time', '\n\nAt the California Institute of Technology, they’re developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars', '  At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they’re using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities', '  With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe need to get behind this innovation', '  And to help pay for it, I’m asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies', '  (Applause', ')  I don’t know if -- I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but they’re doing just fine on their own', '  (Laughter', ')  So instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy, let’s invest in tomorrow’s', '\n\nNow, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they’re selling', '  So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal:  By 2035, 80 percent of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSome folks want wind and solar', '  Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas', '  To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen', '  (Applause', ')\n\nMaintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America’s success', '  But if we want to win the future -– if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -– then we also have to win the race to educate our kids', '\n\nThink about it', '  Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education', '  And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school', '  The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations', '  America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree', '  And so the question is whether all of us –- as citizens, and as parents –- are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed', '\n\nThat responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities', '  It’s family that first instills the love of learning in a child', '  Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done', '  We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair', '  (Applause', ')  We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline', '\n\nOur schools share this responsibility', '  When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance', '  But too many schools don’t meet this test', ' That’s why instead of just pouring money into a system that’s not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top', '  To all 50 states, we said, “If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we’ll show you the money', '”\n\nRace to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation', '  For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning', '  And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country', '  And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that’s more flexible and focused on what’s best for our kids', '  (Applause', ')\n\nYou see, we know what’s possible from our children when reform isn’t just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities', '  Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver', '  Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs', '  But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma', '  Most will be the first in their families to go to college', '  And after the first year of the school’s transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, “Thank you, Ms', ' Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it', '”  (Applause', ')  That’s what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country', '\n\nLet’s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom', '  In South Korea, teachers are known as “nation builders', '”  Here in America, it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect', '  (Applause', ')  We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones', '  (Applause', ')  And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn fact, to every young person listening tonight who’s contemplating their career choice:  If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher', '  Your country needs you', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOf course, the education race doesn’t end with a high school diploma', '  To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American', '  (Applause', ')  That’s why we’ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students', '  (Applause', ')  And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit –- worth $10,000 for four years of college', '  It’s the right thing to do', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBecause people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today’s fast-changing economy, we’re also revitalizing America’s community colleges', '  Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina', '  Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town', '  One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old', '  And she told me she’s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too', '  As Kathy said, “I hope it tells them to never give up', '”\n\nIf we take these steps -– if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take –- we will reach the goal that I set two years ago:  By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOne last point about education', '  Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens', '  Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents', ' They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation', '  Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities', '  But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us', '  It makes no sense', '\n\nNow, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration', '  And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows', '  (Applause', ')  I know that debate will be difficult', '  I know it will take time', '  But tonight, let’s agree to make that effort', '  And let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe third step in winning the future is rebuilding America', '  To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOur infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped', '  South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do', '  Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do', '  China is building faster trains and newer airports', '  Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation’s infrastructure, they gave us a “D', '”\n\nWe have to do better', '  America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System', '  The jobs created by these projects didn’t just come from laying down track or pavement', '  They came from businesses that opened near a town’s new train station or the new off-ramp', '\n\nSo over the last two years, we’ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry', '  And tonight, I’m proposing that we redouble those efforts', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe’ll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges', '  We’ll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what’s best for the economy, not politicians', '\n\nWithin 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail', '  (Applause', ')  This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car', '  For some trips, it will be faster than flying –- without the pat-down', '  (Laughter and applause', ')  As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway', '\n\nWithin the next five years, we’ll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans', '  This isn’t just about -- (applause) -- this isn’t about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls', '  It’s about connecting every part of America to the digital age', '  It’s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world', '  It’s about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor', '\n\nAll these investments -– in innovation, education, and infrastructure –- will make America a better place to do business and create jobs', '  But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success', '\n\nFor example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries', '  Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all', '  But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world', '  It makes no sense, and it has to change', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSo tonight, I’m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system', '  Get rid of the loopholes', '  Level the playing field', '  And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years –- without adding to our deficit', '  It can be done', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTo help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home', '  Already, our exports are up', '  Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States', '  And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs', '  This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible', '  (Applause', ')\n\nNow, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs', '  That’s what we did with Korea, and that’s what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTo reduce barriers to growth and investment, I’ve ordered a review of government regulations', '  When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them', '  (Applause', ')  But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people', '  (Applause', ')  That’s what we’ve done in this country for more than a century', '  It’s why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe', '  It’s why we have speed limits and child labor laws', '  It’s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis', '  (Applause', ')  And it’s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients', '  (Applause', ')\n\nNow, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law', '  (Laughter', ')  So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved', '  If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you', '  We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWhat I’m not willing to do -- what I’m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI’m not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered', '  I’m not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees', '  As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients’ -- parents’ coverage', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSo I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and let’s move forward', '  (Applause', ')\n\nNow, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren’t buried under a mountain of debt', '\n\nWe are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago', '  And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people’s pockets', '\n\nBut now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in', '  That is not sustainable', '  Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means', '  They deserve a government that does the same', '\n\nSo tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years', '  (Applause', ')  Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President', '\n\nThis freeze will require painful cuts', '  Already, we’ve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years', '  I’ve proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs', '  The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I’m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without', '  But let’s make sure that we’re not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens', '  (Applause', ')  And let’s make sure that what we’re cutting is really excess weight', '  Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine', '  It may make you feel like you’re flying high at first, but it won’t take long before you feel the impact', '  (Laughter', ')\n\nNow, most of the cuts and savings I’ve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget', '  To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough', '  It won’t', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear', '  I don’t agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress', '  And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it –- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThis means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit', '  The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit', '  Still, I’m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTo put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations', '  (Applause', ')  We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAnd if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can’t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans', '  (Applause', ')  Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break', '  It’s not a matter of punishing their success', '  It’s about promoting America’s success', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code', '  (Applause', ')  This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSo now is the time to act', '  Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress –- Democrats and Republicans -– to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done', '  If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future', '\n\nLet me take this one step further', '  We shouldn’t just give our people a government that’s more affordable', '  We should give them a government that’s more competent and more efficient', '  We can’t win the future with a government of the past', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV', '  There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports', '  There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy', '  Then there’s my favorite example:  The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they’re in saltwater', '  (Laughter', ')  I hear it gets even more complicated once they’re smoked', '  (Laughter and applause', ')\n\nNow, we’ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste', '  Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse', '  We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we’ll cut through red tape to get rid of more', '  But we need to think bigger', '  In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America', '  I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote –- and we will push to get it passed', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn the coming year, we’ll also work to rebuild people’s faith in the institution of government', '  Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you’ll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history', '  Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online', '  And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren’t larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this:  If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it', '  I will veto it', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe 21st century government that’s open and competent', '  A government that lives within its means', '  An economy that’s driven by new skills and new ideas', '  Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation', '  It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs', '\n\nJust as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges', '  No single wall separates East and West', '  No one rival superpower is aligned against us', '\n\nAnd so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion', '  And America’s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity', '  And because we’ve begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America’s standing has been restored', '\n\nLook to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high', '  (Applause', ')  American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed', '  This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq', '  America’s commitment has been kept', '  The Iraq war is coming to an end', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOf course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us', '  Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we’re disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies', '  And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family', '  (Applause', ')    \n\nWe’ve also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad', '  In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces', '  Our purpose is clear:  By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11', '\n\nThanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency', '  There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance', '  But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them', '  This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead', '  And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn Pakistan, al Qaeda’s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001', '  Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield', '  Their safe havens are shrinking', '  And we’ve sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe:  We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAmerican leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war', '  Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed', '  Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBecause of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before', '  And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThis is just a part of how we’re shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity', '  With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense', '  We’ve reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India', '\n\nThis March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas', '  Around the globe, we’re standing with those who take responsibility -– helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity', '\n\nRecent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power -– it must also be the purpose behind it', '  In south Sudan -– with our assistance -– the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war', '  (Applause', ')  Thousands lined up before dawn', '  People danced in the streets', '  One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him:  “This was a battlefield for most of my life,” he said', '  “Now we want to be free', '”  (Applause', ')\n\nAnd we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator', '  And tonight, let us be clear:  The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe must never forget that the things we’ve struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere', '  And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families', '  Let us serve them as well as they’ve served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation', '\n\nOur troops come from every corner of this country -– they’re black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American', '  They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim', '  And, yes, we know that some of them are gay', '  Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love', '  (Applause', ')  And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC', '  It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past', '  It is time to move forward as one nation', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe should have no illusions about the work ahead of us', ' Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit –- none of this will be easy', '  All of it will take time', '  And it will be harder because we will argue about everything', '  The costs', '  The details', '  The letter of every law', '\n\nOf course, some countries don’t have this problem', '  If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed', '  If they don’t want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn’t get written', '\n\nAnd yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn’t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution', '  We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try', '  We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible', '  No matter who you are', '  No matter where you come from', '\n\nThat dream is why I can stand here before you tonight', '  That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me', '  (Laughter and applause', ')  That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father’s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThat dream -– that American Dream -– is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era', '  It’s what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future', '  And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher', '\n\nBrandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology', '  And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them', '\n\nBut Brandon thought his company could help', '  And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B', '  His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment', '  And Brandon left for Chile', '\n\nAlong with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep', '  Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued', '  (Applause', ')  But because he didn’t want all of the attention, Brandon wasn’t there when the miners emerged', '  He’d already gone back home, back to work on his next project', '\n\nAnd later, one of his employees said of the rescue, “We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things', '”  (Applause', ')\n\nWe do big things',

2,speeches\obama2012.txt,obama,2012," Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:

Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq.  Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.

We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.  (Applause.)  For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.  (Applause.)  For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country.  (Applause.)  Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been defeated.  The Taliban’s momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.

These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.  At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.  They’re not consumed with personal ambition.  They don’t obsess over their differences.  They focus on the mission at hand.  They work together. 

Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.  (Applause.)  Think about the America within our reach:  A country that leads the world in educating its people.  An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.  A future where we’re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the world.  An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.

We can do this.  I know we can, because we’ve done it before.  At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known.  (Applause.)  My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.  My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.
 
The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.  They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. 

The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive.  No challenge is more urgent.  No debate is more important.  We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.  (Applause.)  What’s at stake aren’t Democratic values or Republican values, but American values.  And we have to reclaim them.

Let’s remember how we got here.  Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.  Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.  Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up.

In 2008, the house of cards collapsed.  We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them.  Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money.  Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior.

It was wrong.  It was irresponsible.  And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.  In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs.  And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.

Those are the facts.  But so are these:  In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs.  (Applause.)

Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005.  American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s.  Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion.  And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.  (Applause.)

The state of our Union is getting stronger.  And we’ve come too far to turn back now.  As long as I’m President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum.  But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.  (Applause.)  

No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits.  Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that’s built to last -– an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.

Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing.

On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse.  Some even said we should let it die.  With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.  In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.  We got workers and automakers to settle their differences.  We got the industry to retool and restructure.  Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s number-one automaker.  (Applause.)  Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company.  Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories.  And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.   

We bet on American workers.  We bet on American ingenuity.  And tonight, the American auto industry is back.  (Applause.)  

What’s happening in Detroit can happen in other industries.  It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.  We can’t bring every job back that’s left our shore.  But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China.  Meanwhile, America is more productive.  A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home.  (Applause.)  Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.  (Applause.)  

So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back.  But we have to seize it.  Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple:  Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.  (Applause.)  

We should start with our tax code.  Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.  Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world.  It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.  So let’s change it. 

First, if you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it.  (Applause.)  That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.  (Applause.)  

Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.  (Applause.)  From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax.  And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.  (Applause.)    

Third, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut.  If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here.  And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.  (Applause.)  

So my message is simple.  It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.  Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away.  (Applause.)     

We’re also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world.  Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.  With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule.  (Applause.)  And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.  Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.  (Applause.)     

I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products.  And I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules.  We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration –- and it’s made a difference.  (Applause.)  Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.  But we need to do more.  It’s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.  It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized.

Tonight, I’m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.  (Applause.)  There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.  And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.  Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will always win.  (Applause.) 

I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the right skills.  Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job.  Think about that –- openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.  It’s inexcusable.  And we know how to fix it.  

Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic.  Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.  The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training.  It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant.

I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.  Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.  (Applause.)  My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help.  Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running.  Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing.

And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need.  It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.  (Applause.)
   
These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today.  But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier.

For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time that’s happened in a generation.

But challenges remain.  And we know how to solve them.

At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers.  We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000.  A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.  Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.  Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference.

Teachers matter.  So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal.  Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones.  (Applause.)  And in return, grant schools flexibility:  to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn.  That’s a bargain worth making.  (Applause.)

We also know that when students don’t walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma.  When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better.  So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.  (Applause.)

When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college.  At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.  (Applause.)

Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.  (Applause.)

Of course, it’s not enough for us to increase student aid.  We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of money.  States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.  And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down.

Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that.  Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly.  Some use better technology.  The point is, it’s possible.  So let me put colleges and universities on notice:  If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.  (Applause.)  Higher education can’t be a luxury -– it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.

Let’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge:  the fact that they aren’t yet American citizens.  Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.  Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. 

That doesn’t make sense.   

I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration.  That’s why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before.  That’s why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.  The opponents of action are out of excuses.  We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.  (Applause.)

But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let’s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country.  Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship.  I will sign it right away.  (Applause.)

You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country.  That means women should earn equal pay for equal work.  (Applause.)  It means we should support everyone who’s willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.  

After all, innovation is what America has always been about.  Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses.  So let’s pass an agenda that helps them succeed.  Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow.  (Applause.)  Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs.  Both parties agree on these ideas.  So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.  (Applause.)

Innovation also demands basic research.  Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.  New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.  Don’t gut these investments in our budget.  Don’t let other countries win the race for the future.  Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries.

And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.  Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.  (Applause.)  Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years.  That’s right -- eight years.  Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.  (Applause.)

But with only 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough.  This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.  (Applause.)  A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.

We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.  (Applause.)  And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.  Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.  And I’m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.  (Applause.)  Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.

The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy.  (Applause.)  And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock –- reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.  (Applause.)          

Now, what’s true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy.  In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.  Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. 

When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.  But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.  Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.  Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be working in the industry of the future.”

Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don’t always come right away.  Some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail.  But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.  I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.  (Applause.)  I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. 

We’ve subsidized oil companies for a century.  That’s long enough.  (Applause.)  It’s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.  Pass clean energy tax credits.  Create these jobs.  (Applause.)

We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.  The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.  But there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.  So far, you haven’t acted.  Well, tonight, I will.  I’m directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.  And I’m proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -– with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.  (Applause.) 

Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy.  So here’s a proposal:  Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.  Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them.  Send me a bill that creates these jobs.  (Applause.)  

Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.  So much of America needs to be rebuilt.  We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world. 

During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.  After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways.  Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.

In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.  But you need to fund these projects.  Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.  (Applause.)

There’s never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst.  Of course, construction workers weren’t the only ones who were hurt.  So were millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline.  And while government can’t fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.  

And that’s why I’m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.  (Applause.)  No more red tape.  No more runaround from the banks.  A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.  (Applause.)

Let’s never forget:  Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same.  It’s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom.  No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts.  An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody. 

We’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them.  That’s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.  (Applause.)  Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don’t destroy the free market.  They make the free market work better.

There’s no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly.  In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.  (Applause.)  I’ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don’t make sense.  We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years.  We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.  With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.  (Laughter and applause.)

Now, I’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder.  (Applause.)  Absolutely.  But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago.  (Applause.)  I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.  I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men.  (Applause.)

And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.  The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose:  Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college.

So if you are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits.  You’re required to write out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail –- because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again.  (Applause.)  And if you’re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.  Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job:  To look out for them.  (Applause.)   

We’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments.  Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no real penalty for being a repeat offender.  That’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.  So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count. 

And tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.  (Applause.)  This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans. 

Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy.  But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.

Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.  (Applause.)  People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year.  There are plenty of ways to get this done.  So let’s agree right here, right now:  No side issues.  No drama.  Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.  Let’s get it done.  (Applause.)

When it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings.  But we need to do more, and that means making choices.  Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.  Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.  Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.  

Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.  Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else –- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans.  Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both.  

The American people know what the right choice is.  So do I.  As I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors. 

But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.  (Applause.)

Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule.  If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.  And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right:  Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.  In fact, if you’re earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.  On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.  (Applause.)  You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.  You’re the ones who need relief.   

Now, you can call this class warfare all you want.  But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes.  Most Americans would call that common sense. 

We don’t begrudge financial success in this country.  We admire it.  When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it’s not because they envy the rich.  It’s because they understand that when I get a tax break I don’t need and the country can’t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet.  That’s not right.  Americans know that’s not right.  They know that this generation’s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility.  That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit.  That’s an America built to last.  (Applause.)

Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care.  But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now:  Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken.

Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical. 

The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.  It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.  Who benefited from that fiasco.

I’ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.  But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year.

Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics.  So together, let’s take some steps to fix that.  Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow.  (Applause.)  Let’s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.  Let’s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. 

Some of what’s broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days.  A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the Senate.  (Applause.)  Neither party has been blameless in these tactics.  Now both parties should put an end to it.  (Applause.)  For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.  (Applause.)  

The executive branch also needs to change.  Too often, it’s inefficient, outdated and remote.  (Applause.)  That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.  (Applause.)  

Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town.  We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas. 

I’m a Democrat.  But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:  That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.  (Applause.)  That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and states.  That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that don’t work.  That’s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government program. 

On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home. 

The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective government.  And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress.  With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow.  But I can do a whole lot more with your help.  Because when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America can’t achieve.  (Applause.)  That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.

Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.  From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can’t escape the reach of the United States of America.  (Applause.)

From this position of strength, we’ve begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan.  Ten thousand of our troops have come home.  Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer.  This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.  (Applause.)

As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana’a to Tripoli.  A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American blood on his hands.  Today, he is gone.  And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied.  (Applause.)

How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain.  But we have a huge stake in the outcome.  And while it’s ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well.  We will stand against violence and intimidation.  We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings –- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.  We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.

And we will safeguard America’s own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests.  Look at Iran.  Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.  The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent.

Let there be no doubt:  America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.  (Applause.)

But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.

The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe.  Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever.  Our ties to the Americas are deeper.  Our ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israel’s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.  (Applause.)

We’ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope.  From the coalitions we’ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we’ve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back. 

Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.  (Applause.)

That’s not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us.  That’s not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they’ve been in years.  Yes, the world is changing.  No, we can’t control every event.  But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and as long as I’m President, I intend to keep it that way.  (Applause.)  

That’s why, working with our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget.  To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.  (Applause.) 

Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it.  (Applause.)  As they come home, we must serve them as well as they’ve served us.  That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned –- which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.  (Applause.)  And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation.

With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets.  Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families.  And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.  (Applause.)

Which brings me back to where I began.  Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops.  When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight.  When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails.  When you’re in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind.

One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden.  On it are each of their names.  Some may be Democrats.  Some may be Republicans.  But that doesn’t matter.  Just like it didn’t matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for president. 

All that mattered that day was the mission.  No one thought about politics.  No one thought about themselves.  One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission.  It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs.  More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there’s somebody behind you, watching your back.

So it is with America.  Each time I look at that flag, I’m reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes.  No one built this country on their own.  This nation is great because we built it together.  This nation is great because we worked as a team.  This nation is great because we get each other’s backs.  And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.  As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)",42204,"[' Mr', ' Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n\nLast month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq', '  Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives', '\n\nWe gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world', '  (Applause', ')  For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq', '  (Applause', ')  For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country', '  (Applause', ')  Most of al Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been defeated', '  The Taliban’s momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home', '\n\nThese achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces', '  At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations', '  They’re not consumed with personal ambition', '  They don’t obsess over their differences', '  They focus on the mission at hand', '  They work together', ' \n\nImagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example', '  (Applause', ')  Think about the America within our reach:  A country that leads the world in educating its people', '  An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs', '  A future where we’re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the world', '  An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded', '\n\nWe can do this', '  I know we can, because we’ve done it before', '  At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known', '  (Applause', ')  My grandfather, a veteran of Patton’s Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill', '  My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth', '\n \nThe two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism', '  They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement', ' \n\nThe defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive', '  No challenge is more urgent', '  No debate is more important', '  We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules', '  (Applause', ')  What’s at stake aren’t Democratic values or Republican values, but American values', '  And we have to reclaim them', '\n\nLet’s remember how we got here', '  Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores', '  Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete', '  Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up', '\n\nIn 2008, the house of cards collapsed', '  We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them', '  Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money', '  Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior', '\n\nIt was wrong', '  It was irresponsible', '  And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag', '  In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs', '  And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect', '\n\nThose are the facts', '  But so are these:  In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs', '  (Applause', ')\n\nLast year, they created the most jobs since 2005', '  American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s', '  Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion', '  And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe state of our Union is getting stronger', '  And we’ve come too far to turn back now', '  As long as I’m President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum', '  But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nNo, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits', '  Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that’s built to last -– an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values', '\n\nNow, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing', '\n\nOn the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse', '  Some even said we should let it die', '  With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen', '  In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility', '  We got workers and automakers to settle their differences', '  We got the industry to retool and restructure', '  Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s number-one automaker', '  (Applause', ')  Chrysler has grown faster in the U', 'S', ' than any major car company', '  Ford is investing billions in U', 'S', ' plants and factories', '  And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs', '   \n\nWe bet on American workers', '  We bet on American ingenuity', '  And tonight, the American auto industry is back', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nWhat’s happening in Detroit can happen in other industries', '  It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh', '  We can’t bring every job back that’s left our shore', '  But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China', '  Meanwhile, America is more productive', '  A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home', '  (Applause', ')  Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nSo we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back', '  But we have to seize it', '  Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple:  Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nWe should start with our tax code', '  Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas', '  Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world', '  It makes no sense, and everyone knows it', '  So let’s change it', ' \n\nFirst, if you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it', '  (Applause', ')  That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nSecond, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas', '  (Applause', ')  From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax', '  And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America', '  (Applause', ')    \n\nThird, if you’re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut', '  If you’re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here', '  And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nSo my message is simple', '  It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America', '  Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away', '  (Applause', ')     \n\nWe’re also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world', '  Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U', 'S', ' exports over five years', '  With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule', '  (Applause', ')  And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea', '  Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago', '  (Applause', ')     \n\nI will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products', '  And I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules', '  We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration –- and it’s made a difference', '  (Applause', ')  Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires', '  But we need to do more', '  It’s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated', '  It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized', '\n\nTonight, I’m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China', '  (Applause', ')  There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders', '  And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia', '  Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -– America will always win', '  (Applause', ') \n\nI also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the right skills', '  Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job', '  Think about that –- openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work', '  It’s inexcusable', '  And we know how to fix it', '  \n\nJackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic', '  Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College', '  The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training', '  It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant', '\n\nI want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did', '  Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job', '  (Applause', ')  My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help', '  Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running', '  Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers -– places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing', '\n\nAnd I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need', '  It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work', '  (Applause', ')\n   \nThese reforms will help people get jobs that are open today', '  But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier', '\n\nFor less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time that’s happened in a generation', '\n\nBut challenges remain', '  And we know how to solve them', '\n\nAt a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers', '  We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000', '  A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance', '  Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives', '  Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference', '\n\nTeachers matter', '  So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal', '  Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones', '  (Applause', ')  And in return, grant schools flexibility:  to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren’t helping kids learn', '  That’s a bargain worth making', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe also know that when students don’t walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma', '  When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better', '  So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWhen kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college', '  At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July', '  (Applause', ')\n\nExtend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOf course, it’s not enough for us to increase student aid', '  We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we’ll run out of money', '  States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets', '  And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down', '\n\nRecently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who’ve done just that', '  Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly', '  Some use better technology', '  The point is, it’s possible', '  So let me put colleges and universities on notice:  If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down', '  (Applause', ')  Higher education can’t be a luxury -– it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford', '\n\nLet’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge:  the fact that they aren’t yet American citizens', '  Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation', '  Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else', ' \n\nThat doesn’t make sense', '   \n\nI believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration', '  That’s why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before', '  That’s why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office', '  The opponents of action are out of excuses', '  We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBut if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let’s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country', '  Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship', '  I will sign it right away', '  (Applause', ')\n\nYou see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country', '  That means women should earn equal pay for equal work', '  (Applause', ')  It means we should support everyone who’s willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs', '  \n\nAfter all, innovation is what America has always been about', '  Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses', '  So let’s pass an agenda that helps them succeed', '  Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow', '  (Applause', ')  Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs', '  Both parties agree on these ideas', '  So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year', '  (Applause', ')\n\nInnovation also demands basic research', '  Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched', '  New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet', '  Don’t gut these investments in our budget', '  Don’t let other countries win the race for the future', '  Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries', '\n\nAnd nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy', '  Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources', '  (Applause', ')  Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years', '  That’s right -- eight years', '  Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBut with only 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough', '  This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy', '  (Applause', ')  A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs', '\n\nWe have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years', '  (Applause', ')  And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy', '  Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade', '  And I’m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use', '  (Applause', ')  Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk', '\n\nThe development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy', '  (Applause', ')  And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock –- reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground', '  (Applause', ')          \n\nNow, what’s true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy', '  In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world’s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries', '  Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it', ' \n\nWhen Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance', '  But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan', '  Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts', '  Today, it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be working in the industry of the future', '”\n\nOur experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don’t always come right away', '  Some technologies don’t pan out; some companies fail', '  But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy', '  I will not walk away from workers like Bryan', '  (Applause', ')  I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here', ' \n\nWe’ve subsidized oil companies for a century', '  That’s long enough', '  (Applause', ')  It’s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising', '  Pass clean energy tax credits', '  Create these jobs', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe can also spur energy innovation with new incentives', '  The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change', '  But there’s no reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation', '  So far, you haven’t acted', '  Well, tonight, I will', '  I’m directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes', '  And I’m proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world’s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -– with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year', '  (Applause', ') \n\nOf course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy', '  So here’s a proposal:  Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings', '  Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them', '  Send me a bill that creates these jobs', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nBuilding this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure', '  So much of America needs to be rebuilt', '  We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world', ' \n\nDuring the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge', '  After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways', '  Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today', '\n\nIn the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects', '  But you need to fund these projects', '  Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThere’s never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst', '  Of course, construction workers weren’t the only ones who were hurt', '  So were millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their home values decline', '  And while government can’t fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief', '  \n\nAnd that’s why I’m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates', '  (Applause', ')  No more red tape', '  No more runaround from the banks', '  A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust', '  (Applause', ')\n\nLet’s never forget:  Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same', '  It’s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom', '  No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts', '  An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody', ' \n\nWe’ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them', '  That’s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior', '  (Applause', ')  Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don’t destroy the free market', '  They make the free market work better', '\n\nThere’s no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly', '  In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his', '  (Applause', ')  I’ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don’t make sense', '  We’ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years', '  We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil', '  With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk', '  (Laughter and applause', ')\n\nNow, I’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder', '  (Applause', ')  Absolutely', '  But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago', '  (Applause', ')  I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean', '  I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAnd I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules', '  The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose:  Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college', '\n\nSo if you are a big bank or financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers’ deposits', '  You’re required to write out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail –- because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again', '  (Applause', ')  And if you’re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over', '  Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job:  To look out for them', '  (Applause', ')   \n\nWe’ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people’s investments', '  Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there’s no real penalty for being a repeat offender', '  That’s bad for consumers, and it’s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing', '  So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count', ' \n\nAnd tonight, I’m asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis', '  (Applause', ')  This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans', ' \n\nNow, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy', '  But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future', '\n\nRight now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile', '  (Applause', ')  People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year', '  There are plenty of ways to get this done', '  So let’s agree right here, right now:  No side issues', '  No drama', '  Pass the payroll tax cut without delay', '  Let’s get it done', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWhen it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings', '  But we need to do more, and that means making choices', '  Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans', '  Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households', '  Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary', '  \n\nDo we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans', '  Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else –- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans', '  Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both', '  \n\nThe American people know what the right choice is', '  So do I', '  As I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors', ' \n\nBut in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTax reform should follow the Buffett Rule', '  If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes', '  And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right:  Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires', '  In fact, if you’re earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions', '  On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn’t go up', '  (Applause', ')  You’re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages', '  You’re the ones who need relief', '   \n\nNow, you can call this class warfare all you want', '  But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes', '  Most Americans would call that common sense', ' \n\nWe don’t begrudge financial success in this country', '  We admire it', '  When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it’s not because they envy the rich', '  It’s because they understand that when I get a tax break I don’t need and the country can’t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet', '  That’s not right', '  Americans know that’s not right', '  They know that this generation’s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility', '  That’s how we’ll reduce our deficit', '  That’s an America built to last', '  (Applause', ')\n\nNow, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care', '  But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now:  Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken', '\n\nCan you blame them for feeling a little cynical', ' \n\nThe greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control', '  It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not', '  Who benefited from that fiasco', '\n\nI’ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street', '  But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year', '\n\nSome of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics', '  So together, let’s take some steps to fix that', '  Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow', '  (Applause', ')  Let’s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact', '  Let’s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington', ' \n\nSome of what’s broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days', '  A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything -– even routine business –- passed through the Senate', '  (Applause', ')  Neither party has been blameless in these tactics', '  Now both parties should put an end to it', '  (Applause', ')  For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nThe executive branch also needs to change', '  Too often, it’s inefficient, outdated and remote', '  (Applause', ')  That’s why I’ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nFinally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town', '  We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas', ' \n\nI’m a Democrat', '  But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:  That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more', '  (Applause', ')  That’s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and states', '  That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that don’t work', '  That’s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government program', ' \n\nOn the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home', ' \n\nThe point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective government', '  And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress', '  With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow', '  But I can do a whole lot more with your help', '  Because when we act together, there’s nothing the United States of America can’t achieve', '  (Applause', ')  That’s the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years', '\n\nEnding the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies', '  From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can’t escape the reach of the United States of America', '  (Applause', ')\n\nFrom this position of strength, we’ve begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan', '  Ten thousand of our troops have come home', '  Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer', '  This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAs the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana’a to Tripoli', '  A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world’s longest-serving dictators -– a murderer with American blood on his hands', '  Today, he is gone', '  And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied', '  (Applause', ')\n\nHow this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain', '  But we have a huge stake in the outcome', '  And while it’s ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well', '  We will stand against violence and intimidation', '  We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings –- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews', '  We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty', '\n\nAnd we will safeguard America’s own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests', '  Look at Iran', '  Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one', '  The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent', '\n\nLet there be no doubt:  America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBut a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations', '\n\nThe renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe', '  Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever', '  Our ties to the Americas are deeper', '  Our ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israel’s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe’ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope', '  From the coalitions we’ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we’ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we’ve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back', ' \n\nAnyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn’t know what they’re talking about', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThat’s not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us', '  That’s not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they’ve been in years', '  Yes, the world is changing', '  No, we can’t control every event', '  But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs –- and as long as I’m President, I intend to keep it that way', '  (Applause', ')  \n\nThat’s why, working with our military leaders, I’ve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget', '  To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats', '  (Applause', ') \n\nAbove all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it', '  (Applause', ')  As they come home, we must serve them as well as they’ve served us', '  That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned –- which is why we’ve increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President', '  (Applause', ')  And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation', '\n\nWith the bipartisan support of this Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets', '  Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families', '  And tonight, I’m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWhich brings me back to where I began', '  Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops', '  When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if you’re black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight', '  When you’re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails', '  When you’re in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind', '\n\nOne of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden', '  On it are each of their names', '  Some may be Democrats', '  Some may be Republicans', '  But that doesn’t matter', '  Just like it didn’t matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bush’s defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for president', ' \n\nAll that mattered that day was the mission', '  No one thought about politics', '  No one thought about themselves', '  One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve credit for the mission', '  It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs', '  More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because you can’t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that

get each other’s backs', '  And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard', '  As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong', '\n\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America', '  (Applause', ')']",518,81.47490347490347,17.34406540661958,26.228014157842694
3,speeches\obama2013.txt,obama,2013,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens:  
 
Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this chamber that “the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.”  (Applause.) “It is my task,” he said, “to report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all.”  
 
Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report.  After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home.  (Applause.)  After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs.  We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in 20.  (Applause.)  Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.  (Applause.)  
 
So, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger.  (Applause.) 
 
But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.  Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still can’t find full-time employment.  Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.  
 
It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class.  (Applause.)  
 
It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love.
 
It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.  (Applause.) 
 
The American people don’t expect government to solve every problem.  They don’t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.  But they do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party.  (Applause.)  They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.  For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.
 
Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.
 
Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.  As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.    
 
Now we need to finish the job.  And the question is, how. 
 
In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.  These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.  They’d devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research.  They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.  That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea.  
 
Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits.  That idea is even worse.  (Applause.)  
 
Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.  
 
But we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.  (Applause.)  We won’t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters.  Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.  They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.  And that’s the approach I offer tonight.  
On Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.  (Applause.)  
 
Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.  (Applause.)  And the reforms I’m proposing go even further.  We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.  (Applause.)  We’ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.  (Applause.)  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.  Our government shouldn’t make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises we’ve already made.  (Applause.) 
 
To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected.  After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks.  How is that fair.  Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes.  How does that promote growth.  (Applause.) 
 
Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.  (Applause.)  We can get this done.  The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.  That’s what tax reform can deliver.  That’s what we can do together.  (Applause.) 
 
I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy.  The politics will be hard for both sides.  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.  But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.  So let’s set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.  And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.  (Applause.)  The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.  (Applause.)  We can't do it.  
 
Let’s agree right here, right now to keep the people’s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.  (Applause.)  
 
Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda.  But let’s be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.  (Applause.)  A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.  (Applause.)  Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores.  How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs.  And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living. 
 
A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.  And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda.  I urge this Congress to pass the rest.  (Applause.)  But tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.  Let me repeat -- nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.  It is not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.  (Applause.)  That's what we should be looking for. 
 
Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.  After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three.  Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.  Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico.  And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.  (Applause.)
 
There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend.  Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio.  A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.  There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns.  
 
So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.  And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.  We can get that done.  (Applause.)
 
Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas.  Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar.  Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s.  They’re developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful.  Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation.  Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.  We need to make those investments.  (Applause.)  
Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.  After years of talking about it, we’re finally poised to control our own energy future.  We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.  (Applause.)  We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it.  We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it.  And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.
 
But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.  (Applause.)  Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend.  But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are now more frequent and more intense.  We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence.  Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it’s too late.  (Applause.)
 
Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.  I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.  But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will.  (Applause.)  I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
 
Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it.  And we’ve begun to change that.  Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America.  So let’s generate even more.  Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- let’s drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we.
 
Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence.  We need to encourage that.  And that’s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits.  (Applause.)  That’s got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan.  But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.
 
In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together.  So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.  If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we.  Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long.  
 
I’m also issuing a new goal for America:  Let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.  (Applause.)  We'll work with the states to do it.  Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen.
 
America’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.  Ask any CEO where they’d rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids.  The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they’ll bring even more jobs.  And that’s the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world.  And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district.  I’ve seen all those ribbon-cuttings. (Laughter.)  
 
So tonight, I propose a “Fix-It-First” program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. (Applause.)  And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most:  modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children.  (Applause.)  Let’s prove that there’s no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let’s start right away.  We can get this done.
 
And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.  The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.  Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years.  Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.  
 
But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.  Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.  That’s holding our entire economy back.  We need to fix it.  
 
Right now, there’s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today’s rates.  Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for. Take a vote, and send me that bill.  (Applause.)  Why would we be against that.  (Applause.)  Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance.  Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.  What’s holding us back.  Let’s streamline the process, and help our economy grow.
 
These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing -- all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs.  But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.  (Applause.)  
 
And that has to start at the earliest possible age.  Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road.  But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program.  Most middle-class parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool.  And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.  So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.  (Applause.)  That's something we should be able to do.  
 
Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime.  In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own.  We know this works.  So let’s do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let’s give our kids that chance.  (Applause.) 
 
Let’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job.  Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges.  So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school.  They've been trained for the jobs that are there.  Now at schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering.  
We need to give every American student opportunities like this.  (Applause.)  
 
And four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year.  Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesign America’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.  And we’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math -- the skills today’s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.
 
Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education.  It’s a simple fact the more education you’ve got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class.  But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.
 
Through tax credits, grants and better loans, we’ve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years.  But taxpayers can’t keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education.  Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it’s our job to make sure that they do.  (Applause.)
 
So tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.  (Applause.) And tomorrow, my administration will release a new “College Scorecard” that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria -- where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.   
 
Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today’s jobs require.  But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who’s willing to work -- everybody who’s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead.
 
Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants.  (Applause.)  And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities -- they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.  (Applause.)  Now is the time to do it.  Now is the time to get it done.  Now is the time to get it done.  (Applause.) 
 
Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made -- putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.  
 
Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.  (Applause.)  
 
And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.  (Applause.)   
 
In other words, we know what needs to be done.  And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts.  So let’s get this done.  Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.  And America will be better for it.  (Applause.)  Let’s get it done.  Let’s get it done.  
 
But we can’t stop there.  We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence.  Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago.  And I now urge the House to do the same.  (Applause.)  Good job, Joe.  And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.  (Applause.) 
 
We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages.  But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.  Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line.  That’s wrong.  That’s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.
 
Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.  (Applause.) We should be able to get that done.  (Applause.)
 
This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.  It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead.  For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.  And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government.  In fact, working folks shouldn’t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.  So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year -- let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.  (Applause.)
 
Tonight, let’s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead.  Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up.  Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job.  America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny.  And that’s why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.
 
Let’s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore. Let’s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods.  And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet.  We’ll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, and education, and housing.  
 
We’ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.  And we’ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do more to encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a child; it’s having the courage to raise one.  And we want to encourage that.  We want to help that. (Applause.)
 
Stronger families.  Stronger communities.  A stronger America.  It is this kind of prosperity -- broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class -- that has always been the source of our progress at home.  It’s also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world. 
 
Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us.  Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda.  (Applause.)  
 
Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women.  This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead.  Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan.  This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.  (Applause.)   
 
Beyond 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change.  We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions -- training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates. 
 
Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self.  (Applause.)  It's true, different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.  The threat these groups pose is evolving.  But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations.  Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali.  And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.  (Applause.)  
 
Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight.  That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts.  Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts.  I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we’re doing things the right way.  So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.  (Applause.) 
 
Of course, our challenges don’t end with al Qaeda.  America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world’s most dangerous weapons.  The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.  Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.  
 
Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. (Applause.) 
 
At the same time, we’ll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations.
 
America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks.  (Applause.)  Now, we know hackers steal people’s identities and infiltrate private emails.  We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.  Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems.  We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.  
 
And that’s why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy.  (Applause.)
 
But now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.  This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis.  (Applause.) 
 
Now, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today’s world presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities.  To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And tonight, I’m announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union -- because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.  (Applause.) 
 
We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all -- not only because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, but also because it’s the right thing to do.  In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day.  So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy; by empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve, and helping communities to feed, and power, and educate themselves; by saving the world’s children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach.  (Applause.)   
 
You see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change.  I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, “There is justice and law in the United States.  I want our country to be like that.”
 
In defense of freedom, we’ll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia.  In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy.  (Applause.)  
 
We know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt, but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people.  We’ll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian.  And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace.  (Applause.)  
 
These are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.  And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk –- our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.  As long as I’m Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known.  (Applause.) 
 
We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending.  We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers, and equal benefits for their families -- gay and straight.  (Applause.)  We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat.  
 
We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors -- (applause) -- supporting our military families; giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned.  And I want to thank my wife, Michelle, and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us. Thank you, honey.  Thank you, Jill.  (Applause.)  
 
Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone.  We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home.  That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy:  the right to vote.  (Applause.)  When any American, no matter where they live or what their party, are denied that right because they can’t afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals.  (Applause.)  
 
So tonight, I’m announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America.  And it definitely needs improvement.  I’m asking two long-time experts in the field -- who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney’s campaign -- to lead it.  We can fix this, and we will.  The American people demand it, and so does our democracy.  (Applause.)
 
Of course, what I’ve said tonight matters little if we don’t come together to protect our most precious resource:  our children.  It has been two months since Newtown.  I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence.  But this time is different.  Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.  (Applause.)  Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals.  Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they’re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned.  
 
Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.  (Applause.)  Now, if you want to vote no, that’s your choice.  But these proposals deserve a vote.  Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun -- more than a thousand. 
 
One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.  She was 15 years old.  She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.  She was a majorette.  She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend.  Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration.  And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.
 
Hadiya’s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.  They deserve a vote.  They deserve a vote.  (Applause.)  Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.  (Applause.)  The families of Newtown deserve a vote.  (Applause.) The families of Aurora deserve a vote.  (Applause.)  The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence –- they deserve a simple vote.  (Applause.)  They deserve a simple vote.  
 
Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.  In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I’ve outlined tonight.  But we were never sent here to be perfect.  We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.
 
We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country.  We should follow their example.
 
We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez.  When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn’t thinking about how her own home was faring. Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe. 
 
We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor.  When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours.  And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say.  And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her -- because Desiline is 102 years old.  (Applause.)  And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, “I voted.” (Applause.) 
 
We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.  When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety.  He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds.  And when asked how he did that, Brian said, “That’s just the way we’re made.” 
 
That’s just the way we’re made.  We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us.  But as Americans, we all share the same proud title -- we are citizens.  It’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or legal status.  It describes the way we’re made.  It describes what we believe.  It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story.  
 
Thank you.  God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.  (Applause.) ",41202,"['Mr', ' Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens:  \n \nFifty-one years ago, John F', ' Kennedy declared to this chamber that “the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress', '”  (Applause', ') “It is my task,” he said, “to report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all', '”  \n \nTonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report', '  After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home', '  (Applause', ')  After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs', '  We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in 20', '  (Applause', ')  Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nSo, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger', '  (Applause', ') \n \nBut we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded', '  Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still can’t find full-time employment', '  Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged', '  \n \nIt is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nIt is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love', '\n \nIt is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation', '  (Applause', ') \n \nThe American people don’t expect government to solve every problem', '  They don’t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue', '  But they do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party', '  (Applause', ')  They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can', '  For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all', '\n \nOur work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery', '\n \nOver the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2', '5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans', '  As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances', '    \n \nNow we need to finish the job', '  And the question is, how', ' \n \nIn 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year', '  These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness', '  They’d devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research', '  They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs', '  That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea', '  \n \nNow, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits', '  That idea is even worse', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nYes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population', '  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations', '  \n \nBut we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful', '  (Applause', ')  We won’t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters', '  Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity', '  They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share', '  And that’s the approach I offer tonight', '  \nOn Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nAlready, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs', '  (Applause', ')  And the reforms I’m proposing go even further', '  We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors', '  (Applause', ')  We’ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive', '  (Applause', ')  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement', '  Our government shouldn’t make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises we’ve already made', '  (Applause', ') \n \nTo hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected', '  After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks', '  How is that fair', '  Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes', '  How does that promote growth', '  (Applause', ') \n \nNow is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit', '  (Applause', ')  We can get this done', '  The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America', '  That’s what tax reform can deliver', '  That’s what we can do together', '  (Applause', ') \n \nI realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy', '  The politics will be hard for both sides', '  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want', '  But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans', '  So let’s set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future', '  And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors', '  (Applause', ')  The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next', '  (Applause', "")  We can't do it"", '  \n \nLet’s agree right here, right now to keep the people’s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America', '  (Applause', ')  The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nNow, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda', '  But let’s be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan', '  (Applause', ')  A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts', '  (Applause', ')  Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores', '  How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs', '  And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living', ' \n \nA year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs', '  And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda', '  I urge this Congress to pass the rest', '  (Applause', ')  But tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago', '  Let me repeat -- nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime', '  It is not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth', '  (Applause', "")  That's what we should be looking for"", ' \n \nOur first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing', '  After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three', '  Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan', '  Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico', '  And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again', '  (Applause', ')\n \nThere are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend', '  Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio', '  A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything', '  There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns', '  \n \nSo tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs', '  And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America', '  We can get that done', '  (Applause', ')\n \nNow, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas', '  Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar', '  Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s', '  They’re developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful', '  Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation', '  Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race', '  We need to make those investments', '  (Applause', ')  \nToday, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy', '  After years of talking about it, we’re finally poised to control our own energy future', '  We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years', '  (Applause', ')  We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it', '  We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it', '  And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen', '\n \nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change', '  (Applause', ')  Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend', '  But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15', '  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are now more frequent and more intense', '  We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence', '  Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it’s too late', '  (Applause', ')\n \nNow, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth', '  I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago', '  But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will', '  (Applause', ')  I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy', '\n \nFour years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it', '  And we’ve begun to change that', '  Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America', '  So let’s generate even more', '  Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- let’s drive down costs even further', ' As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we', '\n \nNow, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence', '  We need to encourage that', '  And that’s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits', '  (Applause', ')  That’s got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan', '  But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water', '\n \nIn fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together', '  So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good', '  If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we', '  Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long', '  \n \nI’m also issuing a new goal for America:  Let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years', '  (Applause', "")  We'll work with the states to do it"", '  Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen', '\n \nAmerica’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair', '  Ask any CEO where they’d rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids', '  The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they’ll bring even more jobs', '  And that’s the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world', '  And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district', '  I’ve seen all those ribbon-cuttings', ' (Laughter', ')  \n \nSo tonight, I propose a “Fix-It-First” program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country', ' (Applause', ')  And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most:  modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children', '  (Applause', ')  Let’s prove that there’s no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let’s start right away', '  We can get this done', '\n \nAnd part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector', '  The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007', '  Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years', '  Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again', '  \n \nBut even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected', '  Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no', '  That’s holding our entire economy back', '  We need to fix it', '  \n \nRight now, there’s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today’s rates', '  Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for', ' Take a vote, and send me that bill', '  (Applause', ')  Why would we be against that', '  (Applause', ')  Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance', '  Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home', '  What’s holding us back', '  Let’s streamline the process, and help our economy grow', '\n \nThese initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing -- all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs', '  But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nAnd that has to start at the earliest possible age', '  Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road', '  But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program', '  Most middle-class parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool', '  And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives', '  So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America', '  (Applause', "")  That's something we should be able to do"", '  \n \nEvery dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime', '  In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own', '  We know this works', '  So let’s do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind', ' Let’s give our kids that chance', '  (Applause', ') \n \nLet’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job', '  Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges', ""  So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school"", ""  They've been trained for the jobs that are there"", ""  Now at schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering"", '  \nWe need to give every American student opportunities like this', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nAnd four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year', '  Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesign America’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy', '  And we’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math -- the skills today’s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future', '\n \nNow, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education', '  It’s a simple fact the more education you’ve got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class', '  But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt', '\n \nThrough tax credits, grants and better loans, we’ve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years', '  But taxpayers can’t keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education', '  Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it’s our job to make sure that they do', '  (Applause', ')\n \nSo tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid', '  (Applause', ') And tomorrow, my administration will release a new “College Scorecard” that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria -- where you can get the most bang for your educational buck', '   \n \nNow, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today’s jobs require', '  But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who’s willing to work -- everybody who’s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead', '\n \nOur economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants', '  (Applause', ')  And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities -- they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform', '  (Applause', ')  Now is the time to do it', '  Now is the time to get it done', '  Now is the time to get it done', '  (Applause', ') \n \nReal reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made -- putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years', '  \n \nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nAnd real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy', '  (Applause', ')   \n \nIn other words, we know what needs to be done', '  And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts', '  So let’s get this done', '  Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away', '  And America will be better for it', '  (Applause', ')  Let’s get it done', '  Let’s get it done', '  \n \nBut we can’t stop there', '  We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence', '  Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago', '  And I now urge the House to do the same', '  (Applause', ')  Good job, Joe', '  And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year', '  (Applause', ') \n \nWe know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages', '  But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year', '  Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line', '  That’s wrong', '  That’s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher', '\n \nTonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9', '00 an hour', '  (Applause', ') We should be able to get that done', '  (Applause', ')\n \nThis single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families', '  It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead', '  For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets', '  And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government', '  In fact, working folks shouldn’t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher', '  So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year -- let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on', '  (Applause', ')\n \nTonight, let’s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead', '  Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up', '  Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job', '  America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny', '  And that’s why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them', '\n \nLet’s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore', ' Let’s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods', '  And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet', '  We’ll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, and education, and housing', '  \n \nWe’ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest', '  And we’ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do more to encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a child; it’s having the courage to raise one', '  And we want to encourage that', '  We want to help that', ' (Applause', ')\n \nStronger families', '  Stronger communities', '  A stronger America', '  It is this kind of prosperity -- broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class -- that has always been the source of our progress at home', '  It’s also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world', ' \n \nTonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us', '  Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nAlready, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women', '  This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead', '  Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan', '  This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over', '  (Applause', ')   \n \nBeyond 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change', ""  We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions -- training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates"", ' \n \nToday, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self', '  (Applause', "")  It's true, different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa"", '  The threat these groups pose is evolving', '  But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations', ""  Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali"", '  And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nNow, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight', ""  That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts"", '  Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts', '  I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we’re doing things the right way', '  So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world', '  (Applause', ') \n \nOf course, our challenges don’t end with al Qaeda', '  America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world’s most dangerous weapons', '  The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations', '  Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats', '  \n \nLikewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon', ' (Applause', ') \n \nAt the same time, we’ll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations', '\n \nAmerica must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks', '  (Applause', ')  Now, we know hackers steal people’s identities and infiltrate private emails', '  We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets', '  Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems', '  We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy', '  \n \nAnd that’s why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy', '  (Applause', ')\n \nBut now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks', '  This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis', '  (Applause', ') \n \nNow, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today’s world presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities', '  To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership', '  And tonight, I’m announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union -- because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs', '  (Applause', ') \n \nWe also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all -- not only because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, but also because it’s the right thing to do', '  In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day', '  So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy; by empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve, and helping communities to feed, and power, and educate themselves; by saving the world’s children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach', '  (Applause', ')   \n \nYou see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change', '  I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, “There is justice and law in the United States', '  I want our country to be like that', '”\n \nIn defense of freedom, we’ll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia', '  In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nWe know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt, but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people', '  We’ll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian', '  And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace', '  (Applause', "")  \n \nThese are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month"", '  And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk –- our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces', '  As long as I’m Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known', '  (Applause', "") \n \nWe'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending"", '  We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers, and equal benefits for their families -- gay and straight', '  (Applause', ')  We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat', '  \n \nWe will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors -- (applause) -- supporting our military families; giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned', '  And I want to thank my wife, Michelle, and Dr', ' Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us', ' Thank you, honey', '  Thank you, Jill', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nDefending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone', '  We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home', '  That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy:  the right to vote', '  (Applause', ')  When any American, no matter where they live or what their party, are denied that right because they can’t afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals', '  (Applause', ')  \n \nSo tonight, I’m announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America', '  And it definitely needs improvement', '  I’m asking two long-time experts in the field -- who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney’s campaign -- to lead it', '  We can fix this, and we will', '  The American people demand it, and so does our democracy', '  (Applause', ')\n \nOf course, what I’ve said tonight matters little if we don’t come together to protect our most precious resource:  our children', '  It has been two months since Newtown', '  I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence', '  But this time is different', '  Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun', '  (Applause', ')  Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals', '  Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they’re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned', '  \n \nEach of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress', '  (Applause', ')  Now, if you want to vote no, that’s your choice', '  But these proposals deserve a vote', '  Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun -- more than a thousand', ' \n \nOne of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton', '  She was 15 years old', '  She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss', '  She was a majorette', '  She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend', '  Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration', '  And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house', '\n \nHadiya’s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence', '  They deserve a vote', '  They deserve a vote', '  (Applause', ')  Gabby Giffords deserves a vote', '  (Applause', ')  The families of Newtown deserve a vote', '  (Applause', ') The families of Aurora deserve a vote', '  (Applause', ')  The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence –- they deserve a simple vote', '  (Applause', ')  They deserve a simple vote', '  \n \nOur actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country', '  In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I’ve outlined tonight', '  But we were never sent here to be perfect', '  We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government', '\n \nWe were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country', '  We should follow their example', '\n \nWe should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez', '  When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn’t thinking about how her own home was faring', ' Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe', ' \n \nWe should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor', '  When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours', '  And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say', '  And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her -- because Desiline is 102 years old', '  (Applause', ')  And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, “I voted', '” (Applause', ') \n \nWe should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy', '  When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety', '  He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds', '  And when asked how he did that, Brian said, “That’s just the way we’re made', '” \n \nThat’s just the way we’re made', '  We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us', '  But as Americans, we all share the same proud title -- we are citizens', '  It’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or legal status', '  It describes the way we’re made', '  It describes what we believe', '  It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that

4,speeches\obama2014.txt,obama,2014,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift America’s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades.

An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years. 

An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil.

A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.  A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.  A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son.  And in tight-knit communities across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end.

Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.

Here are the results of your efforts:  The lowest unemployment rate in over five years.  A rebounding housing market.  A manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.  More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years.  Our deficits – cut by more than half.  And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s number one place to invest; America is.

That’s why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.  After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.

The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.  It’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding.  But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States – then we are not doing right by the American people.

As President, I’m committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.  I believe most of you are, too.  Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education.  Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.  But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises.

In the coming months, let’s see where else we can make progress together.  Let’s make this a year of action.  That’s what most Americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.  And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead.

Let’s face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on.

Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better.  But average wages have barely budged.  Inequality has deepened.  Upward mobility has stalled.  The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead.  And too many still aren’t working at all.

Our job is to reverse these trends.  It won’t happen right away, and we won’t agree on everything.  But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.  Some require Congressional action, and I’m eager to work with all of you.  But America does not stand still – and neither will I.  So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do. 

As usual, our First Lady sets a good example.  Michelle’s Let’s Move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.  The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.  Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.  Across the country, we’re partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality.

The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward.  They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams.  That’s what drew our forebears here.  It’s how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America’s largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth. 

Opportunity is who we are.  And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise.

We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.  And over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.

So let’s make that decision easier for more companies.  Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad.  Let’s flip that equation.  Let’s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home.

Moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.  We’ll need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.  But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.

We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.  My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown, where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.  Tonight, I’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year.  Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.  So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work.

Let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America.  Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other.  And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs.  We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped “Made in the USA.”  China and Europe aren’t standing on the sidelines.  Neither should we.

We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.  This is an edge America cannot surrender.  Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.  That’s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel.  And let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation.

Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy.  The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades.

One of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely, it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.  I’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas.  My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities.  And while we’re at it, I’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.

It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too.  Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced.  Let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do.

And even as we’ve increased energy production, we’ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume.  When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.  In the coming months, I’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump.

Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet.  Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.  But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.  That’s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.  The shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way.  But the debate is settled.  Climate change is a fact.  And when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.

Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system.  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted.  I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same.  Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.  And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study, invent, and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.  So let’s get immigration reform done this year.

The ideas I’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.  But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs.

The good news is, we know how to do it.  Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit.  She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make them.  She just needed the workforce.  So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job.  She was flooded with new workers.  And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees.

What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker.  So tonight, I’ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America’s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.  That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.  It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.  And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.

I’m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy.  But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.

Let me tell you why.

Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager.  She put herself through college.  She’d never collected unemployment benefits.  In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home.  A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved.  Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind I get every day.  “We are the face of the unemployment crisis,” she wrote.  “I am not dependent on the government…Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society…care about our neighbors…I am confident that in time I will find a job…I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love.  Please give us this chance.”

Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance.  They need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game.  That’s why I’ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.  Tonight, I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when America fields a full team. 

Of course, it’s not enough to train today’s workforce.  We also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education.

Estiven Rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine.  But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications.  And this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall.

Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.  We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before.  Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance.  Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.  Some of this change is hard.  It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test.  But it’s worth it – and it’s working. 

The problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids, and we’re not reaching them in time.  That has to change. 

Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education.  Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old.  As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own.  They know we can’t wait.  So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children.  And as Congress decides what it’s going to do, I’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need.

Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.  Tonight, I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit. 

We’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.  We’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education.  We’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.  And I’m reaching out to some of America’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential.

The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us.  But we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American. 

Today, women make up about half our workforce.  But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.  That is wrong, and in 2014, it’s an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.  She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.  A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what, a father does, too.  It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode.  This year, let’s all come together – Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.  Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds.

Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages.  Americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don’t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success.  But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.

In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.  Many businesses have done it on their own.  Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno.  John’s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough.  Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale.

Tonight, I ask more of America’s business leaders to follow John’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages.  To every mayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don’t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on.  And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too.  In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty.

Of course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board. Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here.  Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.  This will help families.  It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.  It doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program.  So join the rest of the country.  Say yes.  Give America a raise.

There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.  But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids.  So let’s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.

Let’s do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers don’t have a pension.  A Social Security check often isn’t enough on its own.  And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks.  That’s why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.  MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.  And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans.  Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.  And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans.

One last point on financial security.  For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.  And in case you haven’t heard, we’re in the process of fixing that.

A pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn’t get health insurance.  But on January 1st, she got covered.  On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.  On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.  Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy.

That’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don’t have to lose everything. 

Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans.

More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage.

And here’s another number: zero.  Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman.  And we did all this while adding years to Medicare’s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.

Now, I don’t expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law.  But I know that the American people aren’t interested in refighting old battles.  So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice – tell America what you’d do differently.  Let’s see if the numbers add up.  But let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.  The first forty were plenty.  We got it.  We all owe it to the American people to say what we’re for, not just what we’re against. 

And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who’s here tonight.  Kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country, but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families.  “They are our friends and neighbors,” he said.  “They are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick.  No one deserves to live that way.” 

Steve’s right.  That’s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.  Moms, get on your kids to sign up.  Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application.  It will give her some peace of mind – plus, she’ll appreciate hearing from you. 

After all, that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.  It’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well.

Citizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote.  Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened.  But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.  Let’s support these efforts.  It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy.

Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.  I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid,” and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.

Citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.  And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.

Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure.  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.  More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.  With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America’s longest war will finally be over.

After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.  If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.  For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country.

The fact is, that danger remains.  While we have put al Qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we’ll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks.  And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions.

We have to remain vigilant.  But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone. As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office.  But I will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.  We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.

So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – America must move off a permanent war footing.  That’s why I’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.  That’s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.  And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world.

You see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy.  American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.  American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel – a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.

And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade.  As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.  It is not installing advanced centrifuges.  Unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb.  And with our allies and partners, we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

These negotiations will be difficult.  They may not succeed.  We are clear-eyed about Iran’s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.  But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.  If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.

The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.  But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.  For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.  If Iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.  But if Iran’s leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war.

Finally, let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.  And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America. 

Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.  From Tunisia to Burma, we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy.  In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country’s future.  Across Africa, we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty.  In the Americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.  And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, “We will never forget your kindness” and “God bless America.”

We do these things because they help promote our long-term security.  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.  And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment – when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium – and brings home the gold.

My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do.  On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them.

No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.  We’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need.  We’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.  And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.

Let me tell you about one of those families I’ve come to know.

I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day.  Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program – a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.  We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.

A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. 

For months, he lay in a coma.  The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn’t speak; he could barely move.  Over the years, he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day. 

Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye.  He still struggles on his left side.  But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again. 

“My recovery has not been easy,” he says. “Nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy.” 

Cory is here tonight.  And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit. 

My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.  Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.  But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.  The America we want for our kids – a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy.  But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – I know it’s within our reach. 

Believe it.

God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",40009,"['Mr', ' Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\n\nToday in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift America’s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades', '\n\nAn entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years', ' \n\nAn autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil', '\n\nA farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history', '  A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford', '  A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son', '  And in tight-knit communities across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end', '\n\nTonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong', '\n\nHere are the results of your efforts:  The lowest unemployment rate in over five years', '  A rebounding housing market', '  A manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s', '  More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years', '  Our deficits – cut by more than half', '  And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s number one place to invest; America is', '\n\nThat’s why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America', '  After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth', '\n\nThe question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress', '  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government', '  It’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding', '  But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States – then we are not doing right by the American people', '\n\nAs President, I’m committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here', '  I believe most of you are, too', '  Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education', '  Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way', '  But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises', '\n\nIn the coming months, let’s see where else we can make progress together', '  Let’s make this a year of action', '  That’s what most Americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations', '  And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead', '\n\nLet’s face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows', '  Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on', '\n\nToday, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better', '  But average wages have barely budged', '  Inequality has deepened', '  Upward mobility has stalled', '  The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead', '  And too many still aren’t working at all', '\n\nOur job is to reverse these trends', '  It won’t happen right away, and we won’t agree on everything', '  But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class', '  Some require Congressional action, and I’m eager to work with all of you', '  But America does not stand still – and neither will I', '  So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do', ' \n\nAs usual, our First Lady sets a good example', '  Michelle’s Let’s Move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come', '  The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses', '  Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus', '  Across the country, we’re partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality', '\n\nThe point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward', '  They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams', '  That’s what drew our forebears here', '  It’s how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America’s largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth', ' \n\nOpportunity is who we are', '  And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise', '\n\nWe know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job', '  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year', '  And over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad', '\n\nSo let’s make that decision easier for more companies', '  Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad', '  Let’s flip that equation', '  Let’s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home', '\n\nMoreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure', '  We’ll need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer', '  But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible', '\n\nWe also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs', '  My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown, where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies', '  Tonight, I’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year', '  Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create', '  So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work', '\n\nLet’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America', '  Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other', '  And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs', '  We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped “Made in the USA', '”  China and Europe aren’t standing on the sidelines', '  Neither should we', '\n\nWe know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow', '  This is an edge America cannot surrender', '  Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones', '  That’s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel', '  And let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation', '\n\nNow, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy', '  The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades', '\n\nOne of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely, it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change', '  Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas', '  I’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas', '  My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities', '  And while we’re at it, I’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations', '\n\nIt’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too', '  Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced', '  Let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do', '\n\nAnd even as we’ve increased energy production, we’ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume', '  When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars', '  In the coming months, I’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump', '\n\nTaken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet', '  Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth', '  But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods', '  That’s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air', '  The shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way', '  But the debate is settled', '  Climate change is a fact', '  And when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did', '\n\nFinally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system', '  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted', '  I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same', '  Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades', '  And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study, invent, and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone', '  So let’s get immigration reform done this year', '\n\nThe ideas I’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs', '  But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs', '\n\nThe good news is, we know how to do it', '  Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit', '  She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make them', '  She just needed the workforce', '  So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job', '  She was flooded with new workers', '  And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees', '\n\nWhat Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker', '  So tonight, I’ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America’s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now', '  That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life', '  It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs', '  And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs', '\n\nI’m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy', '  But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1', '6 million people', '\n\nLet me tell you why', '\n\nMisty DeMars is a mother of two young boys', ' She’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager', '  She put herself through college', '  She’d never collected unemployment benefits', '  In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home', '  A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved', '  Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind I get every day', '  “We are the face of the unemployment crisis,” she wrote', '  “I am not dependent on the government…Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society…care about our neighbors…I am confident that in time I will find a job…I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love', '  Please give us this chance', '”\n\nCongress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance', '  They need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game', '  That’s why I’ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real', '  Tonight, I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when America fields a full team', ' \n\nOf course, it’s not enough to train today’s workforce', '  We also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education', '\n\nEstiven Rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine', '  But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications', '  And this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall', '\n\nFive years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids', '  We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before', '  Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance', '  Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D', 'C', ' are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math', '  Some of this change is hard', '  It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test', '  But it’s worth it – and it’s working', ' \n\nThe problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids, and we’re not reaching them in time', '  That has to change', ' \n\nResearch shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education', '  Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old', '  As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight', ' But in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own', '  They know we can’t wait', '  So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children', '  And as Congress decides what it’s going to do, I’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need', '\n\nLast year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years', '  Tonight, I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit', ' \n\nWe’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career', '  We’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education', '  We’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt', '  And I’m reaching out to some of America’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential', '\n\nThe bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us', '  But we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American', ' \n\nToday, women make up about half our workforce', '  But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns', '  That is wrong, and in 2014, it’s an embarrassment', ' A woman deserves equal pay for equal work', '  She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job', '  A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what, a father does, too', '  It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode', '  This year, let’s all come together – Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves', '  Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds', '\n\nNow, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages', '  Americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don’t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success', '  But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty', '\n\nIn the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs', '  Many businesses have done it on their own', '  Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno', '  John’s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough', '  Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale', '\n\nTonight, I ask more of America’s business leaders to follow John’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages', '  To every mayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don’t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on', '  And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example', ' Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover', ' We should too', '  In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10', '10 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty', '\n\nOf course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board', ' Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here', '  Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10', '10', '  This will help families', '  It will give businesses customers with more money to spend', '  It doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program', '  So join the rest of the country', '  Say yes', '  Give America a raise', '\n\nThere are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit', '  Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point', '  But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids', '  So let’s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead', '\n\nLet’s do more to help Americans save for retirement', ' Today, most workers don’t have a pension', '  A Social Security check often isn’t enough on its own', '  And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks', '  That’s why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA', ' It’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg', '  MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in', '  And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans', '  Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can', '  And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans', '\n\nOne last point on financial security', '  For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system', '  And in case you haven’t heard, we’re in the process of fixing that', '\n\nA pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn’t get health insurance', '  But on January 1st, she got covered', '  On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain', '  On January 6th, she had emergency surgery', '  Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy', '\n\nThat’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don’t have to lose everything', ' \n\nAlready, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans', '\n\nMore than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage', '\n\nAnd here’s another number: zero', '  Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer', ' No woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman', '  And we did all this while adding years to Medicare’s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors', '\n\nNow, I don’t expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law', '  But I know that the American people aren’t interested in refighting old battles', '  So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice – tell America what you’d do differently', '  Let’s see if the numbers add up', '  But let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda', '  The first forty were plenty', '  We got it', '  We all owe it to the American people to say what we’re for, not just what we’re against', ' \n\nAnd if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who’s here tonight', '  Kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country, but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families', '  “They are our friends and neighbors,” he said', '  “They are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick', '  No one deserves to live that way', '” \n\nSteve’s right', '  That’s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st', '  Moms, get on your kids to sign up', '  Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application', '  It will give her some peace of mind – plus, she’ll appreciate hearing from you', ' \n\nAfter all, that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward', '  It’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well', '\n\nCitizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote', '  Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened', '  But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote', '  Let’s support these efforts', '  It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy', '\n\nCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day', '  I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid,” and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook', '\n\nCitizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities', '  And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces', '\n\nTonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure', '  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan', '  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq', '  More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan', '  With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role', ' Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America’s longest war will finally be over', '\n\nAfter 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future', '  If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda', '  For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country', '\n\nThe fact is, that danger remains', '  While we have put al Qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world', ' In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks', ' In Syria, we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks', ' Here at home, we’ll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks', '  And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions', '\n\nWe have to remain vigilant', '  But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone', ' As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office', '  But I will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts', '  We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism', '\n\nSo, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – America must move off a permanent war footing', '  That’s why I’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence', '  That’s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated', '  And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world', '\n\nYou see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy', '  American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles', '  American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear', ' As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel – a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side', '\n\nAnd it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade', '  As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium', '  It is not installing advanced centrifuges', '  Unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb', '  And with our allies and partners, we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon', '\n\nThese negotiations will be difficult', '  They may not succeed', '  We are clear-eyed about Iran’s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away', '  But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb', '  If John F', ' Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today', '\n\nThe sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible', '  But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it', '  For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed', '  If Iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon', '  But if Iran’s leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war', '\n\nFinally, let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want', '  And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America', ' \n\nOur alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known', '  From Tunisia to Burma, we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy', '  In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country’s future', '  Across Africa, we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty', '  In the Americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people', '  And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, “We will never forget your kindness” and “God bless America', '”\n\nWe do these things because they help promote our long-term security', '  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation', '  And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment – when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium – and brings home the gold', '\n\nMy fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do', '  On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them', '\n\nNo one knows this better than those who serve in uniform', '  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life', '  We’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need', '  We’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home', '  And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families', '\n\nLet me tell you about one of those families I’ve come to know', '\n\nI first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day', '  Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program – a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack', '  We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch', '\n\nA few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan', ' His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain', ' \n\nFor months, he lay in a coma', '  The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn’t speak; he could barely move', '  Over the years, he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day', ' \n\nEven now, Cory is still blind in one eye', '  He still struggles on his left side', '  But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger', ' Day by day, he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again', ' \n\n“My recovery has not been easy,” he says', ' “Nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy', '” \n\nCory is here tonight', '  And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit', ' \n\nMy fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy', '  Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy', '  Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged', '  But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen', '  The America we want for our kids – a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy', '  But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – I know it’s within our reach', ' \n\nBelieve it', '\n\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America', '']",352,113.66193181818181,19.06450067129949,9.227648912106872
5,speeches\obama2015.txt,obama,2015,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:
 
We are 15 years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. 
 
But tonight, we turn the page.  Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  (Applause.)  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before.  More of our people are insured than ever before.  (Applause.)  And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.  (Applause.)
 
Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  (Applause.)  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  (Applause.)  We are humbled and grateful for your service.
 
America, for all that we have endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.  (Applause.)
 
At this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come.
 
Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well.  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort.  (Applause.)
 
Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing.  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet.
 
Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another.  Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward.
 
In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.  So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.
 
It begins with our economy.  Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  (Laughter.)  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.  They were young and in love in America.  And it doesn’t get much better than that.  “If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.” 
 
As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction -- and home for dinner every night.
 
“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”  We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.
 
America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped, and sacrificed and retooled.  You are the reason that I ran for this office.  You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.
 
We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.  (Applause.) 
 
We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  (Applause.)  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump.  (Applause.) 
 
We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  More Americans finish college than ever before.  (Applause.) 
 
We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.  (Applause.) 
 
At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.  (Applause.)  This is good news, people.  (Laughter and applause.)
 
So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don’t get in the way.  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got to fix a broken system.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.  It will have earned my veto.  (Applause.) 
 
Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.  But here’s the thing:  Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t screw things up; that government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.  (Applause.) 
 
Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but they’ve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Friday night pizza, that’s a big splurge.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.
 
And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet -- tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them.
 
That’s what middle-class economics is -- the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.  (Applause.)  We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success, we want everyone to contribute to our success.  (Applause.)
 
So what does middle-class economics require in our time. 
 
First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement.  And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.  (Applause.)
 
Here’s one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority -- so this country provided universal childcare.  In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.  (Applause.)
 
It’s not a nice-to-have -- it’s a must-have.  So it’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  (Applause.)  And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America -- by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.  (Applause.)
 
Here’s another example.  Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave -- 43 million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.  And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.  (Applause.)  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It’s the right thing to do.  It’s the right thing to do.  (Applause.)
 
Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  (Applause.)  It’s 2015.  (Laughter.)  It’s time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.  (Applause.)  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.  (Applause.)
 
Now, these ideas won’t make everybody rich, won’t relieve every hardship.  That’s not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.  We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.  (Applause.)
 
But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage -- these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  That’s a fact.  And that’s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.

Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.  (Applause.)  America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.  We were ahead of the curve.  But other countries caught on.  And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game.  We need to do more.
 
By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education -- two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  It’s not fair to them, and it’s sure not smart for our future.  That’s why I’m sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college -- to zero.  (Applause.)   
 
Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.  Understand, you’ve got to earn it.  You’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. 

Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  (Applause.)  Let’s stay ahead of the curve.  (Applause.)  And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.  (Applause.) 
 
Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships -- opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.
 
And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need.  And we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.  And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- (applause) -- thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.  (Applause.)  So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran.  (Applause.)
 
Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.  Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  (Applause.)
 
Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist 10 or 20 years ago -- jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla. 
 
So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  We know that.  (Applause.)  And that’s why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.
 
Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure -- modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.  (Applause.)  Let’s do it.  Let’s get it done.  Let’s get it done.  (Applause.)
 
Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.  But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen.  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but are also fair.  It’s the right thing to do.  (Applause.)
 
Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But 95 percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders.  We can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities.  More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking to bring jobs back from China.  So let’s give them one more reason to get it done.
 
Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine -- one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.  (Applause.)
 
In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  So tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.  We can do this.  (Applause.)
 
I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- (applause) -- and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.
 
I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs -- converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again.  (Applause.)  Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  So good luck, Captain.  Make sure to Instagram it.  We’re proud of you.  (Applause.) 
 
Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  They’ve riddled it with giveaways that the super-rich don’t need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.  
 
This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest here in America.  (Applause.)  Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.  Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford.  (Applause.)  And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.  (Applause.)  We can achieve it together. 
 
Helping hardworking families make ends meet.  Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe it’s where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. 
 
Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. 
 
My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military -- then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  That’s what our enemies want us to do.
 
I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That’s exactly what we’re doing right now.  And around the globe, it is making a difference.
 
First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists -- from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  (Applause.)  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.  (Applause.)   
 
At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years.  Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. 
 
In Iraq and Syria, American leadership -- including our military power -- is stopping ISIL’s advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  (Applause.)  We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. 
 
Now, this effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.  We need that authority.  (Applause.)  
 
Second, we’re demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small -- by opposing Russian aggression, and supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  (Applause.) 
 
Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states, Mr. Putin’s aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  That's what I heard from some folks.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters.  That’s how America leads -- not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.  (Applause.)
 
In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  (Applause.)  When what you’re doing doesn’t work for 50 years, it’s time to try something new.  (Applause.)  And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere.  It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba.  It stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.  (Applause.)
 
As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.”  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan.  We're glad you're here.  (Applause.)
 
Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies -- including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.  There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. 
 
But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails -- alienating America from its allies; making it harder to maintain sanctions; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesn’t make sense.  And that's why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  (Applause.)  The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.
 
Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.  No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  (Applause.)  So we're making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. 
 
And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information.  That should be a bipartisan effort.  (Applause.)
 
If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.
 
In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, our health care workers are rolling back Ebola -- saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  (Applause.)  I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.
 
In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules -- in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge -- no challenge -- poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.  (Applause.)   
 
2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does:  14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.  
I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act.  Well, I’m not a scientist, either.  But you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and at NOAA, and at our major universities.  And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don’t act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.  (Applause.) 
 
And that’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it.  That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action.  (Applause.) 
 
In Beijing, we made a historic announcement:  The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution.  And China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got.
 
And there’s one last pillar of our leadership, and that’s the example of our values. 
 
As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  (Applause.)  It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  (Applause.)  It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.  We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because ultimately they will make us safer.  (Applause.)
 
As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice.  So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  (Applause.)  Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half.  Now it is time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It is not who we are.  It’s time to close Gitmo.  (Applause.)

As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.
 
Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading -- always -- with the example of our values.  That’s what makes us exceptional.  That’s what keeps us strong.  That’s why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards -- our own.
 
You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America or a conservative America; a black America or a white America -- but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home -- a state of small towns, rich farmland, one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.
 
Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws -- of which there are many -- but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naïve, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.
 
I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.  I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.  (Applause.)
 
I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California, and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, New London.  I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West Texas, and West Virginia.  I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 Americans call home.  (Applause.)
 
So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. 
 
So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes.  I’ve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.
 
Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.  Understand, a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues and values, and principles and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives.  (Applause.)   
 
A politics -- a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.
 
If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments, but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs.  (Applause.) 
 
Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.  I’ve talked to Republicans and Democrats about that.  That’s something that we can share.
 
We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many -- (applause) -- and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.  (Applause.) 
 
We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed.  And surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  (Applause.)  And surely we can agree that it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us.  (Applause.) 
 
That’s a better politics.  That’s how we start rebuilding trust.  That’s how we move this country forward.  That’s what the American people want.  And that’s what they deserve.
 
I have no more campaigns to run.  (Applause.)  My only agenda -- (laughter) -- I know because I won both of them.  (Applause.)  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol -- to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.  (Applause.) 
 
Because I want this chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth -- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.
 
I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids.  (Applause.)  I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we’re a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen -- man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  Everybody matters.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.  (Applause.) 
 
I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past six years:  “It’s amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who’s made it through some very, very hard times.”
 
My fellow Americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We have laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Let’s begin this new chapter together -- and let’s start the work right now.  (Applause.) 
 
Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless this country we love.  Thank you.  (Applause.) ",40269,"['Mr', ' Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\n \nWe are 15 years into this new century', '  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world', '  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many', ' \n \nBut tonight, we turn the page', '  Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999', '  (Applause', ')  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis', '  More of our kids are graduating than ever before', '  More of our people are insured than ever before', '  (Applause', ')  And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years', '  (Applause', ')\n \nTonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over', '  (Applause', ')  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan', '  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain', '  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe', '  (Applause', ')  We are humbled and grateful for your service', '\n \nAmerica, for all that we have endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong', '  (Applause', ')\n \nAt this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth', '  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come', '\n \nWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well', '  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort', '  (Applause', ')\n \nWill we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing', '  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet', '\n \nWill we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another', '  Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward', '\n \nIn two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan', '  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas', '  So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us', '\n \nIt begins with our economy', '  Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds', '  (Laughter', ')  She waited tables', '  He worked construction', '  Their first child, Jack, was on the way', '  They were young and in love in America', '  And it doesn’t get much better than that', '  “If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market', '” \n \nAs the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time', '  Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career', '  They sacrificed for each other', '  And slowly, it paid off', '  They bought their first home', '  They had a second son, Henry', '  Rebekah got a better job and then a raise', '  Ben is back in construction -- and home for dinner every night', '\n \n“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times', '”  We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times', '\n \nAmerica, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story', '  They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped, and sacrificed and retooled', '  You are the reason that I ran for this office', '  You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation', '  And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger', '\n \nWe believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores', '  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs', '  (Applause', ') \n \nWe believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet', '  And today, America is number one in oil and gas', '  America is number one in wind power', '  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008', '  (Applause', ')  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump', '  (Applause', ') \n \nWe believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world', '  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record', '  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high', '  More Americans finish college than ever before', '  (Applause', ') \n \nWe believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition', '  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices', '  And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage', '  (Applause', ') \n \nAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits', '  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years', '  (Applause', ')  This is good news, people', '  (Laughter and applause', ')\n \nSo the verdict is clear', '  Middle-class economics works', '  Expanding opportunity works', '  And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don’t get in the way', '  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns', '  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got to fix a broken system', '  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it', '  It will have earned my veto', '  (Applause', ') \n \nToday, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives', '  Wages are finally starting to rise again', '  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007', '  But here’s the thing:  Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t screw things up;

Tonight marks the eighth year I've come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I'm going to try to make it shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.

I also understand that because it's an election season, expectations for what we'll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again.

But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I'll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.

But for my final address to this chamber, I don't want to talk just about the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.

I want to focus on our future.

We live in a time of extraordinary change – change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.

America has been through big changes before – wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the ""dogmas of the quiet past."" Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people. And because we did – because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril – we emerged stronger and better than before.

What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation – our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law – these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.

In fact, it's that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It's how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.

But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people. Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together.

So let's talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer – regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.

First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy.

Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us – especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change.

Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman.

And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us, and not what's worst.

Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We're in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the '90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.

Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. What is true – and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious – is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven't let up. Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.

All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.

For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody. We've made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments we've had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.

We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.

And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.

Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.

That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.

Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job – we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.

I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.

But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years – namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to make.

I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.

In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges.

Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.

That spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world. And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit.

We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.

But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade. Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.

Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.

Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.

But even if the planet wasn't at stake; even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record – until 2015 turned out even hotter – why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future.

Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal – in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy – something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.

Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.

Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future – especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.

None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve – that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.

Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.

I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead – they call us.

As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria – states they see slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.

It's up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set priorities.

Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.

But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That's the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions. We just need to call them what they are – killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.

That's exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.

If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment – or mine – to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.

Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world – in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.

We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq – and we should have learned it by now.

Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.

That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.

That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.

That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.

That's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs. With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this century. Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.

Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere. Recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.

American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world – except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change – that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria – something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.

That's strength. That's leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.

That's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that ""to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place."" When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.

""We the People."" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.

The future we want – opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids – all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.

It will only happen if we fix our politics.

A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. That's one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.

But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.

Too many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets of my presidency – that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.

But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task – or any President's – alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; you've told me. And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.

We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't bankroll our elections – and if our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. We've got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.

But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process – in not just who gets elected but how they get elected – that will only happen when the American people demand it. It will depend on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.

What I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.

We can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.

So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.

It won't be easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I'll be right there with you as a citizen – inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word – voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.

They're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.

I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you. I know you're there. You're the reason why I have such incredible confidence in our future. Because I see your quiet, sturdy citizenship all the time.

I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.

I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.

I see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over – and the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.

I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him 'til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.

It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.

I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.

That's the America I know. That's the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That's why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong.

7,speeches\trump2018.txt,trump,2018,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:

Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People — and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.  That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action.  A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.

Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission — to make America great again for all Americans.

Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.  We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined.  We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.  We endured floods and fires and storms.  But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine.

Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.

We saw the volunteers of the “Cajun Navy,” racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.

We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.

We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.  Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.  Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives.  Thank you, Ashlee.

We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.  He is here with us too.  David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.

To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else — we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.

Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.  With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House — a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later:  the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.

We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.

In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people.  But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.  Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.

Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew:  that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.  If there is a mountain, we climb it.  If there is a frontier, we cross it.  If there is a challenge, we tame it.  If there is an opportunity, we seize it.

So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.

And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.

Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.  After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.

Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.  African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.

Small business confidence is at an all-time high.  The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.  That is great news for Americans’ 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.

And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.

Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.

To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.  Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.  We also doubled the child tax credit.

A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 — slashing their tax bill in half.

This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system — and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.

We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year — forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans.  We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare — the individual mandate is now gone.

We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world.  These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.

Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.

Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing — a small business in Ohio.  They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history.  Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.

One of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.  Corey is an all-American worker.  He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.  Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education.  Please join me in congratulating Corey.

Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands of dollars per worker.  Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.

This is our new American moment.  There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.

So to every citizen watching at home tonight — no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time.  If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.

Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be.  All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.

We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.

Together, we are rediscovering the American way.

In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is “in God we trust.”

And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.

Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.  He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.  Preston:  a job well done.

Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.  Preston’s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.

Americans love their country.  And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.

For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.

Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.

We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.

And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.  Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.  Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve — and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.

I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.

All Americans deserve accountability and respect — and that is what we are giving them.  So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers — and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.

In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.

We have ended the war on American Energy — and we have ended the war on clean coal.  We are now an exporter of energy to the world.

In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America’s autoworkers — so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.

Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States — something we have not seen for decades.    Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.  Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.  This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing — for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.  But now they are coming back.

Exciting progress is happening every day.

To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.

We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.

People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure — I want to give them a chance right here at home.  It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the “right to try.”

One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.  That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities.  Prices will come down.

America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation’s wealth.

The era of economic surrender is over.

From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.

We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.

And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.

As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.

America is a nation of builders.  We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year — is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road.

I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.

Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.

Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment — to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.

Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process — getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.

Together, we can reclaim our building heritage.  We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.  And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.

We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work.  We want every child to be safe in their home at night.  And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.

We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.

As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training.  Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.  And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.

As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens.  That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.

Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.

For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.  They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.

Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers:  Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens.  Their two teenage daughters — Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens — were close friends on Long Island.  But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home.  These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.  Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders.  Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school.

Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.  Everyone in America is grieving for you.  And 320 million hearts are breaking for you.  We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.

Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.

The United States is a compassionate nation.  We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.  But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities.  I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.  I want our poor to have their chance to rise.

So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties — Democrats and Republicans — to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans — to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.  Because Americans are dreamers too.

Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country:  Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez — he goes by CJ.  CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets.  At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder.  But he did not cave to threats or fear.  Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island.  His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.

CJ:  Great work.  Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.

Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.

In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.  Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise — one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.

Here are the four pillars of our plan:

The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age — that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration.  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.

The second pillar fully secures the border.  That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe.  Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country — and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release.”

The third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.  It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system — one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.

The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.  Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.  Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.  This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.

In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.  In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.

It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.

These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.

For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.  This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.

Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.  So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.

These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.

In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:  174 deaths per day.  Seven per hour.  We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.

My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need.  The struggle will be long and difficult — but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.

As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.

We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.  Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.  He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.  She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.

In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:  “You will do it — because you can.”  He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.  Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.  In an instant, she agreed to adopt.  The Holets named their new daughter Hope.

Ryan and Rebecca:  You embody the goodness of our Nation.  Thank you, and congratulations.

As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.

Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.  In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.

For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.

As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.  Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.  Unfortunately, we are not there yet.

Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.  One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.  But there is much more work to be done.  We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.

Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.  Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.

Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.  Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape.  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.  He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.

Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior.  Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.  Raqqa is liberated.  And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor.”  Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you.

Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.  When possible, we annihilate them.  When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.  But we must be clear:  Terrorists are not merely criminals.  They are unlawful enemy combatants.  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.

In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.

So today, I am keeping another promise.  I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay.

I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa’ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists — wherever we chase them down.

Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement.  Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.

Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:  I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition.  American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.

That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends.

As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.

When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.  America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.

I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.

My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.

But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.

North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.

We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.

Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.  I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.

We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.

Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.  On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.  At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.  After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June — horribly injured and on the verge of death.  He passed away just days after his return.

Otto’s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight — along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.  You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve.

Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.  His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.

In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves — permanently stunting their own growth.  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.  He had — and he resolved to be free.

Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.  Most of his family followed.  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.

Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth.

Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.

Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.

It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves.  That they could chart their own destiny.  And that, together, they could light up the world.

That is what our country has always been about.  That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.

Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.  She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.

Monuments to Washington and Jefferson — to Lincoln and King.

Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga — to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.  And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.

And freedom stands tall over one more monument:  this one.  This Capitol.  This living monument to the American people.

A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us — defending hope, pride, and the American way.

They work in every trade.  They sacrifice to raise a family.  They care for our children at home.  They defend our flag abroad.  They are strong moms and brave kids.  They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.

But above all else, they are Americans.  And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.

Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.

Americans fill the world with art and music.  They push the bounds of science and discovery.  And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:  The people dreamed this country. The people built this country.  And it is the people who are making America great again.

As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.

As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.

Our families will thrive.

Our people will prosper.

And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.

Thank you, and God bless America.",30457,"['Mr', ' Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\n\nLess than 1 year has passed

fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities', '  Prices will come down', '\n\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation’s wealth', '\n\nThe era of economic surrender is over', '\n\nFrom now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal', '\n\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones', '\n\nAnd we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules', '\n\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure', '\n\nAmerica is a nation of builders', '  We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year — is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road', '\n\nI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve', '\n\nTonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1', '5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need', '\n\nEvery Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment — to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit', '\n\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process — getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one', '\n\nTogether, we can reclaim our building heritage', '  We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land', '  And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit', '\n\nWe want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work', '  We want every child to be safe in their home at night', '  And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love', '\n\nWe can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity', '\n\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training', '  Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential', '  And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave', '\n\nAs America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens', '  That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance', '\n\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families', '\n\nFor decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities', '  They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans', '  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives', '\n\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers:  Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens', '  Their two teenage daughters — Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens — were close friends on Long Island', '  But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home', '  These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown', '  Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders', '  Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school', '\n\nEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you', '  Everyone in America is grieving for you', '  And 320 million hearts are breaking for you', '  We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain', '\n\nTonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country', '  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again', '\n\nThe United States is a compassionate nation', '  We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world', '  But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities', '  I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things', '  I want our poor to have their chance to rise', '\n\nSo tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties — Democrats and Republicans — to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed', '  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans — to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream', '  Because Americans are dreamers too', '\n\nHere tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country:  Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez — he goes by CJ', '  CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets', '  At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder', '  But he did not cave to threats or fear', '  Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island', '  His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13', '\n\nCJ:  Great work', '  Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements', '\n\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package', '\n\nIn recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform', '  Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise — one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs', '\n\nHere are the four pillars of our plan:\n\nThe first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1', '8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age — that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration', '  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States', '\n\nThe second pillar fully secures the border', '  That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe', '  Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country — and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release', '”\n\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people', '  It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system — one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country', '\n\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration', '  Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives', '  Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children', '  This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future', '\n\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration', '  In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford', '\n\nIt is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century', '\n\nThese four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system', '\n\nFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem', '  This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen', '\n\nMost importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first', '  So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done', '\n\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction', '\n\nIn 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:  174 deaths per day', '  Seven per hour', '  We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge', '\n\nMy Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need', '  The struggle will be long and difficult — but, as Americans always do, we will prevail', '\n\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America', '\n\nWe see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico', '  Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department', '  He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca', '  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin', '  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep', '  She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby', '\n\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:  “You will do it — because you can', '”  He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids', '  Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca', '  In an instant, she agreed to adopt', '  The Holets named their new daughter Hope', '\n\nRyan and Rebecca:  You embody the goodness of our Nation', '  Thank you, and congratulations', '\n\nAs we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad', '\n\nAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values', '  In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense', '\n\nFor this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military', '\n\nAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression', '  Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons', '  Unfortunately, we are not there yet', '\n\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth', '  One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria', '  But there is much more work to be done', '  We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated', '\n\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight', '  Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city', '\n\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion', '  Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape', '  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway', '  He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery', '\n\nKenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior', '  Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas', '  Raqqa is liberated', '  And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor', '”  Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you', '\n\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil', '  When possible, we annihilate them', '  When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them', '  But we must be clear:  Terrorists are not merely criminals', '  They are unlawful enemy combatants', '  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are', '\n\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi', '\n\nSo today, I am keeping another promise', '  I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay', '\n\nI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa’ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists — wherever we chase them down', '\n\nOur warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement', '  Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans', '\n\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:  I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel', '\n\nShortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition', '  American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year', '\n\nThat is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends', '\n\nAs we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries', '\n\nWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent', '  America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom', '\n\nI am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal', '\n\nMy Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela', '\n\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea', '\n\nNorth Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland', '\n\nWe are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening', '\n\nPast experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation', '  I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position', '\n\nWe need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies', '\n\nOtto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia', '  On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea', '  At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state', '  After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June — horribly injured and on the verge of death', '  He passed away just days after his return', '\n\nOtto’s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight — along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta', '  You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all', '  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve', '\n\nFinally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime', '  His name is Mr', ' Ji Seong-ho', '\n\nIn 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea', '  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food', '  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger', '  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs', '  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain', '  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves — permanently stunting their own growth', '  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China', '  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians', '  He had — and he resolved to be free', '\n\nSeong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom', '  Most of his family followed', '  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death', '\n\nToday he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth', '\n\nToday he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come', '  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all', '\n\nSeong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom', '\n\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America', '  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness', '  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves', '  That they could chart their own destiny', '  And that, together, they could light up the world', '\n\nThat is what our country has always been about', '  That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done', '\n\nAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom', '  She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her', '\n\nMonuments to Washington and Jefferson — to Lincoln and King', '\n\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga — to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond', '  And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia', '\n\nAnd freedom stands tall over one more monument:  this one', '  This Capitol', '  This living monument to the American people', '\n\nA people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us — defending hope, pride, and the American way', '\n\nThey work in every trade', '  They sacrifice to raise a family', '  They care for our children at home', '  They defend our flag abroad', '  They are strong moms and brave kids', '  They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines', '\n\nBut above all else, they are Americans', '  And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them', '\n\nOur task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them', '\n\nAmericans fill the world with art and music', '  They push the bounds of science and discovery', '  And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:  The people dreamed this country', ' The people built this country', '  And it is the people who are making America great again', '\n\nAs long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve', '\n\nAs long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail', '\n\nOur families will thrive', '\n\nOur people will prosper', '\n\nAnd our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free', '\n\nThank you, and God bless America', '']",323,94.29411764705883,13.84361068175401,51.03448989662204
8,speeches\trump2019.txt,trump,2019,"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:

We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.  As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.

Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.

The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.  It is the agenda of the American people.

Many of us campaigned on the same core promises:  to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.

There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it.  Victory is not winning for our party.  Victory is winning for our country.

This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission, and the power of American pride.

In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.  On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny.  Here with us tonight are three of those heroes:  Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.  Gentlemen, we salute you.

In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.  Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag:  Buzz Aldrin.  This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.

In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.  Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.  An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.

We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.

But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.

Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.  We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.  The decision is ours to make.

We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.

Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.

Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.

In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before.  We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.

Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else.  Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.  The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.  Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low.  More people are working now than at any time in our history –- 157 million.

We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.

We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.

We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.

My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure.  Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.

We have unleashed a revolution in American energy — the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.  And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.

After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.   Members of Congress:  the State of our Union is strong.  Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.

On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double what was expected.  An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.

If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.  It just doesn’t work that way.

We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.

This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate – some after years of waiting.  The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.

Now is the time for bipartisan action.  Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.

In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.

And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.  Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson.  I was deeply moved.  In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.  Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path.  She had a big impact on that prison population — and far beyond.

Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing — and the need to remedy this injustice.  She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.

In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence — and she is here with us tonight.  Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.

When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.

Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law.  This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community.  The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead.  America is a Nation that believes in redemption.

We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.  In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses.  Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates.  Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.  Matthew, on behalf of all Americans:  welcome home.

As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country.  Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.

The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.

Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.

As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.  We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.  I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.

This is a moral issue.  The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans.  We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.  This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws.  Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.  I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.

Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.

No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.  Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.

Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.

Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel.  One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.  Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.

Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.

Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.

The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border.  Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.  We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in.

Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.

I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.

Here tonight is Debra Bissell.  Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien.  They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.  Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great‑granddaughter, Madison.

To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand:  few can understand your pain.  But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.

Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.

In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.

We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes:  ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.  When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.  At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.  Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.  Elvin says:  “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.”  Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.

Special Agent Hernandez, please stand:  We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.

My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.

It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.  In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built.  I’ll get it built.

This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall.  It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country.  In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place.  This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.

The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.  Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.

Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.  So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.

As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.

No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year.  All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.

As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.

To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.

We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.

Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime.  But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.  I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China.  But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.

Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.

I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA.  For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal.  But no one ever tried — until now.

Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers:  bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:  made in the USA.

Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.

Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.

I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future.  This is not an option.  This is a necessity.

The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

Already, as a result of my Administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.

But we must do more.  It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.

I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients.  We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.

No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.  In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.  Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.  My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.  Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.

Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind:  the fight against childhood cancer.

Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline.  Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.  She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.  Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer.  Immediately, she began radiation treatment.  At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer.  When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:  “Last Day of Chemo.”  Grace — you are an inspiration to us all.

Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.  My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.

To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children.  I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.

There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.  And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.

To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.

Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.

The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security.

Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.  We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.  For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.

As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.

Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.

For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities.  While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms.  That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.

Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.

As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.  Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months.  If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.  Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.  And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.

Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.

We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.

Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.  America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control.  We are born free, and we will stay free.  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.

One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.

Our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.  For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.

Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.  In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives.  More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.  We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.

As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach.  Great nations do not fight endless wars.

When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria.  Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.

Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.

I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan.  Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.

In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.  As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism.  We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.

Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people.  Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.

We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost.  Tom:  we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.

My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.

To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.  And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.

We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.  We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.

Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.  SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.  Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight.  Officer Matson:  we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.

Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet.  He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.  But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps.  Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.  Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp.  Suddenly the train screeched to a halt.  A soldier appeared.  Judah’s family braced for the worst.  Then, his father cried out with joy:  “It’s the Americans.”

A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.  “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”

I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik.  But there is more to Herman’s story.  A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.  He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth.  Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.  Herman and Joshua:  your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.

When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.

They did not know if they would survive the hour.  They did not know if they would grow old.  But they knew that America had to prevail.  Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.

Why did they do it.  They did it for America — they did it for us.

Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.

Think of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.

Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.  You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.  Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.

What will we do with this moment.  How will we be remembered.

I ask the men and women of this Congress:  Look at the opportunities before us.  Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.  Our most exciting journeys still await.  Our biggest victories are still to come.  We have not yet begun to dream.

We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.

We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans.  We do the incredible.  We defy the impossible.  We conquer the unknown.

This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination.  This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star.  This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.

This is our future — our fate — and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.

No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.

We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny — that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world.

Thank you.  God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night.",30945,"['Madam Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\n\nWe meet tonight

'\n\nOver the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades', '\n\nIn just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before', '  We have created 5', '3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing

Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible', '\n\nIn the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new

parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform', '  Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson', '  I was deeply moved', '  In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison

homeland, and secure our southern border', '\n\nNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business', '\n\nAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States', '  We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection', '  I have ordered another 3,750 troops to

divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration', '  Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates

depleted social safety net', '\n\nTolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel', '  One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north', '  Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country', '\n\nHuman traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to

sex trafficking', '  Elvin says:  “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job', '”  Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year', '\n\nSpecial Agent Hernandez, please stand:  We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement — and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE', '\n\nMy Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border', '\n\nIt includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry', '  In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall — but the proper wall never got built', '  I’ll get it built', '\n\nThis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall', '  It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down', '\n\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country', '  In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place', '  This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings', '\n\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities', '  Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities', '\n\nSimply put, walls work and walls save lives', '  So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe', '\n\nAs we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace', '\n\nNo one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year', '  All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before', '\n\nAs part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries', '\n\nTo build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount — reversing decades of calamitous trade policies', '\n\nWe are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end', '\n\nTherefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods — and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime', '  But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us — I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen', '  I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China', '  But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs', '\n\nAnother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA', '\n\nI have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA', '  For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal', '  But no one ever tried — until now', '\n\nOur new U', 'S', '-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers:  bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words:  made in the USA', '\n\nTonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us', '\n\nBoth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure', '\n\nI know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future', '  This is not an option', '  This is a necessity', '\n\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions', '\n\nAlready, as a result of my Administration’s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years', '\n\nBut we must do more', '  It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place', '  This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it', '\n\nI am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients', '  We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down', '\n\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom', '  In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS', '  Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach', '  My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years', '  Together, we will defeat AIDS in America', '\n\nTonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind:  the fight against childhood cancer', '\n\nJoining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline', '  Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St', ' Jude Children’s Research Hospital', '  She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself', '  Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer', '  Immediately, she began radiation treatment', '  At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer', '  When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:  “Last Day of Chemo', '”  Grace — you are an inspiration to us all', '\n\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades', '  My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research', '\n\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America’s children', '  I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave — so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child', '\n\nThere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days', '  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth', '  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world', '  And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth', '\n\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb', '\n\nLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life', '  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God', '\n\nThe final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security', '\n\nOver the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military — with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year', '  We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share', '  For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO — but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies', '\n\nAs part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System', '\n\nUnder my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests', '\n\nFor example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities', '  While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms', '  That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty', '\n\nPerhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far', '\n\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula', '  Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months', '  If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed', '  Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one', '  And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam', '\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido', '\n\nWe stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair', '\n\nHere, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country', '  America was founded on liberty and independence –- not government coercion, domination, and control', '  We are born free, and we will stay free', '  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country', '\n\nOne of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East', '\n\nOur approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress', '  For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel — and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem', '\n\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years', '  In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives', '  More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded', '  We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East', '\n\nAs a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach', '  Great nations do not fight endless wars', '\n\nWhen I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria', '  Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers', '\n\nNow, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home', '\n\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan', '  Our troops have fought with unmatched valor — and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict', '\n\nIn Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban', '  As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism', '  We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement — but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace', '\n\nAbove all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation’s power and will to defend our people', '  Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole — and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack', '\n\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost', '  Tom:  we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole', '\n\nMy Administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran', '\n\nTo ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal', '  And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country', '\n\nWe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people', '  We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed', '  With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs', '\n\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh', '  SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer', '  Timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight', '  Officer Matson:  we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil', '\n\nTonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet', '  He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began', '  But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps', '  Today is Judah’s 81st birthday', '  Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp', '  Suddenly the train screeched to a halt', '  A soldier appeared', '  Judah’s family braced for the worst', '  Then, his father cried out with joy:  “It’s the Americans', '”\n\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp', ' He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks', '  “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky', '”\n\nI began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War', ' One of them was Herman Zeitchik', '  But there is more to Herman’s story', '  A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau', '  He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth', '  Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom', '  Herman and Joshua:  your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation', '\n\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war', '\n\nThey did not know if they would survive the hour', '  They did not know if they would grow old', '  But they knew that America had to prevail', '  Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn', '\n\nWhy did they do it', '  They did it for America — they did it for us', '\n\nEverything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before', '\n\nThink of this Capitol — think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire', '\n\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic', '  You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California', '  Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history', '\n\nWhat will we do with this moment', '  How will we be remembered', '\n\nI ask the men and women of this Congress:  Look at the opportunities before us', '  Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead', '  Our most exciting journeys still await', '  Our biggest victories are still to come', '  We have not yet begun to dream', '\n\nWe must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them', '\n\nWe must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans', '  We do the incredible', '  We defy the impossible', '  We conquer the unknown', '\n\nThis is the time to re-ignite the American imagination', '  This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star', '  This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots', '\n\nThis is our future — our fate — and our choice to make', ' I am asking you to choose greatness', '\n\nNo matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together', '\n\nWe must keep America first in our hearts', '  We must keep freedom alive in our souls', '  And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny — that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world', '\n\nThank you', '  God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night', '']",298,103.84228187919463,14.799099541914204,44.106259681903715
9,speeches\trump2020.txt,trump,2020," Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States — (applause) — and my fellow citizens:

Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback.  Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results.  Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.  (Applause.)  America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright.

The years of economic decay are over.  (Applause.)  The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us.  (Applause.)  Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.

In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny.  We have totally rejected the downsizing.  We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.  (Applause.)

I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.  Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world — and it’s not even close.  Our borders are secure.  Our families are flourishing.  Our values are renewed.  Our pride is restored.  And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before.  (Applause.)

The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society — one where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise.

From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements.  (Applause.)  Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high.

Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs — 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.  (Applause.)

The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.  (Applause.)  And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  True.  If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.  (Applause.)

The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.  (Applause.)  African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.  (Applause.)  African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.  (Applause.)

The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years.  And, last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.  (Applause.)

The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low.  (Applause.)  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.  (Applause.)

Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history.  (Applause.)  A record number of young Americans are now employed.  (Applause.)

Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls.  Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.  (Applause.)

In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce.  In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people — working-age people — have joined the workforce.  (Applause.)

Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent — three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.  (Applause.)  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election.  (Applause.)  This is a blue-collar boom.  (Applause.)

Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.  (Applause.)

Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible.  This is a record.  It is something that every country in the world is looking up to.  They admire.  (Applause.)  Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs.

All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more.

Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts.  (Applause.)  In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement.  (Applause.)  This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this.  It’s all working.

Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio.  After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family.  He was homeless.  But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones.  He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight.  Tony, keep up the great work.  Tony.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Tony.

Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start.  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law.  Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.  (Applause.)

Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far.  (Applause.)  With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high.  (Applause.)  We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago.

Likewise, we are restoring our nation’s manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done.  After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built.  (Applause.)  Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA.  (Applause.)  The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is.  (Applause.)

One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal.  (Applause.)  In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President.  Following NAFTA’s adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs.  Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened.  But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.  We did our job.  (Applause.)

Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.  The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.  (Applause.)  It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity.  We will have that: fairness and reciprocity.  And I say that, finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade.  (Applause.)

This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions.  (Applause.)

I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of America’s jobs.  Our strategy has worked.  Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA.  (Applause.)

For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States.  Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever had with China, including with President Xi.  They respect what we’ve done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, “That’s enough.”  (Applause.)  Now we want to rebuild our country, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  We are rebuilding our country.

As we restore — (applause) — American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere.  (Applause.)  That’s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.  (Applause.)

We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy.  The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.  (Applause.)  Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people.  But Maduro’s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.

Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans.  Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó.  (Applause.)  Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Mr. President.  Great honor.  Thank you very much.

Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.

Socialism destroys nations.  But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul.  (Applause.)

To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military.  (Applause.)  We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it’s all made right here in the USA.  (Applause.)

We are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of Allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.

And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces.  It’s called the Space Force.  (Applause.)  Very important.

In the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman.  And what he wants so badly — 13 years old — Iain Lanphier.  He’s an eighth grader from Arizona.  Iain, please stand up.

Iain has always dreamed of going to space.  He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy.  He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force.  As Iain says, “Most people look up at space.  I want to look down on the world.”  (Laughter and applause.)

But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all.  Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago.  Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen — the first black fighter pilots — and he also happens to be Iain’s great-grandfather.  (Applause.)  Incredible story.

After more than 130 combat missions in World War Two, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam.  On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday.  (Applause.)  A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General.  And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office.  General McGee, our nation salutes you.  Thank you, sir.  (Applause.)

From the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future.

Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.  (Applause.)  The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country.  We must always remember that our job is to put America first.  (Applause.)

The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.  Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools.  To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships.  The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.

One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia.  Janiyah.  (Applause.)  Janiyah’s mom, Stephanie, is a single parent.  She would do anything to give her daughter a better future.  But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children.

Janiyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery.  Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

But, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over.  I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice.  (Applause.)

Now I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received.  Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act — because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.  (Applause.)

Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow.  For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the BE BEST initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation — online, in school, and in our communities.  Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background.  Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.

My budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation’s high schools.  Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.  (Applause.)

To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation’s historically black colleges and universities.  (Applause.)

A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth.  Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years.  I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives.  Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive — and better.  (Applause.)

I’ve also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.  (Applause).  And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security.  Always.  (Applause.)

The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills.  That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency.  (Applause.)  Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform.  (Applause.)  It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.

But as we work to improve Americans’ healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely.

AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans.  To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare.  (Applause.)

Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders.  These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration.  That is what is happening in California and other states.  Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money.

If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left.  But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens.  (Applause.)

This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built.  (Applause.)  We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time.  Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed.

My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies.  We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before.  (Applause.)  And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.  (Applause.)

And working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels.  I’ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly.  I’m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices.  Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately.  (Applause.)

AUDIENCE:  H.R.3.  H.R.3.  H.R.3.

With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic.  Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years.  (Applause.)  Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent — and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.  (Applause.)

Protecting Americans’ health also means fighting infectious diseases.  We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.  My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.

We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health.  And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade.  (Applause.)

Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness.  Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis.  This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.  Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country.  (Applause.)

And, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  (Applause.)

I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor.  Please.  (Applause.)

(The Medal of Freedom is presented.)  (Applause.)

Rush and Kathryn, congratulations.  Thank you, Kathryn.

As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs.  In 2017, doctors at St. Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive.  Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter.  Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life.  Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery.  Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight.  (Applause.)

Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life.  And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive.  It’s an incredible thing.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie.  That is why I’m asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America’s youngest patients.  (Applause.)

That is why I’m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.  (Applause.)  Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God.

As we support America’s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country.  (Applause.)

Now I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation.  (Applause.)

Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit.  (Applause.)  I’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether.  (Applause.)  And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality child care, and urge you to act immediately.  (Applause.)

To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world.  (Applause.)

We must also rebuild America’s infrastructure.  (Applause.)  I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso’s highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land.

I’m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet, including and especially in rural America.  (Applause.)

A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe.  That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation’s heroic ICE officers.  (Applause.)

Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.

Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens.

AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.

Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman.  The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York’s sanctuary policies, he was set free.  If the city had honored ICE’s detainer request, his victim would still be alive today.

The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants — a very terrible sanctuary — with catastrophic results.

Here is just one tragic example.  In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault.  But as required by California’s Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.

Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence.  He viciously shot one man going about his daily work.  He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest.  He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon.  He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims.  One of the victims is — a terrible, terrible situation; died — 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones.

Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood.  Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world.  One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight.  Jody, would you please stand.  Jody, thank you.  (Applause.)  Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice.

Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices.  (Applause.)

I ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately.  The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.  (Applause.)

In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers.  And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe.  My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.  (Applause.)

Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.  My administration has ended catch and release.  (Applause.)  If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country.  (Applause.)

Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row.  (Applause.)  And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly.

Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz.  Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants.  Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight.  Chief Ortiz, please stand.  (Applause.)  A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.  (Applause.)

With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. (Applause.)  Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — thank you, Mitch — (applause) — and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written.  This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And we have many in the pipeline.  (Laughter and applause.)

My administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools.  (Applause.)  In America, we don’t punish prayer.  We don’t tear down crosses.  We don’t ban symbols of faith.  We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors.  In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God.

Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country.  So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  (Applause.)

In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.  Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars.  I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts — (applause) — using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.  (Applause.)

My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)

Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future.

Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria.  Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS — the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi — is dead.  (Applause.)

We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller.  After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker.  She once wrote, “Some people find God in church.  Some people find God in nature.  Some people find God in love.  I find God in suffering.  I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.”  In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself.  After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla.  She was just 26 years old.

On the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room.  He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: “Task Force 8-14.”  It was a reference to a special day: August 14th — Kayla’s birthday.  Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla — and neither will we.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

Every day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart.

One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake.  On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage: “I will be with you again,” he wrote to Gage.  “I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also.  I love you son.  Take care of your mother.  I am always with you.  Daddy.”

On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.  That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well.  To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.  He is looking down on you now.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you both very much.

The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life.  Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.  As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children.  He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq.  Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard.  And that’s why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.  (Applause.)

Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice.  If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life.  (Applause.)

In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers.  The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people.

Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly.  We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery.  It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help.  We are here.  Let’s see which road they choose.  It is totally up to them.  (Applause.)

As we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s wars in the Middle East.

In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway.  I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent.  It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies.  These are warfighters that we have — the best in the world — and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.  We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home.  (Applause.)

War places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children — six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan.  Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families.  For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East.  Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months.  Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you.  Thank you, Amy.  (Applause.)

But, Amy, there is one more thing.  Tonight, we have a very special surprise.  I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment.  He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.  (Applause.)

AUDIENCE:  USA.  USA.  USA.

THE PRESIDENT:  Welcome home, Sergeant Williams.  Thank you very much.

As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes.  This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life.  This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur.  This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more.  This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley.  This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo — (applause) — the beautiful, beautiful Alamo.

The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth.  Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers.  And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before.  (Applause.)

This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.  We are Americans.  We are pioneers.  We are the pathfinders.  We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.  (Applause.)

America is the place where anything can happen.  America is the place where anyone can rise.  And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.

This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece.  We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.  Our brightest discoveries are not yet known.  Our most thrilling stories are not yet told.  Our grandest journeys are not yet made.  The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun.

Our spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God’s grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come.  (Applause.)

Thank you.  God Bless You.  And God Bless America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",39649,"[' Thank you very much', '  Thank you', '  Thank you very much', '\n\nMadam Speaker, Mr', ' Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States — (applause) — and my fellow citizens:\n\nThree years ago, we launched the great American comeback', '  Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results', '  Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again', '  (Applause', ')  America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright', '\n\nThe years of economic decay are over', '  (Applause', ')  The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us', '  (Applause', ')  Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige', '\n\nIn just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny', '  We have totally rejected the downsizing', '  We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been', '  Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world — and it’s not even close', '  Our borders are secure', '  Our families are flourishing', '  Our values are renewed', '  Our pride is restored', '  And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society — one where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise', '\n\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U', 'S', ' economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements', '  (Applause', ')  Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American', '  (Applause', ')  Thank you', '  We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high', '\n\nSince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs — 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century', '  (Applause', ')  And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country', '  (Applause', ')  True', '  If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history', '  (Applause', ')  African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low', '  (Applause', ')  African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years', '  And, last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low', '  (Applause', ')  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWorkers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U', 'S', ' history', '  (Applause', ')  A record number of young Americans are now employed', '  (Applause', ')\n\nUnder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls', '  Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce', '  In just three years of my administration, 3', '5 million people — working-age people — have joined the workforce', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent — three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent', '  (Applause', ')  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election', '  (Applause', ')  This is a blue-collar boom', '  (Applause', ')\n\nReal median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSince my election, U', 'S', ' stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible', '  This is a record', '  It is something that every country in the world is looking up to', '  They admire', '  (Applause', ')  Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs', '\n\nAll of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more', '\n\nJobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts', '  (Applause', ')  In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement', '  (Applause', ')  This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this', '  It’s all working', '\n\nOpportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio', '  After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family', '  He was homeless', '  But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones', '  He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight', '  Tony, keep up the great work', '  Tony', '  (Applause', ')  Thank you, Tony', '\n\nOur roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start', '  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law', '  Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far', '  (Applause', ')  With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high', '  (Applause', ')  We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago', '\n\nLikewise, we are restoring our nation’s manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done', '  After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built', '  (Applause', ')  Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA', '  (Applause', ')  The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOne of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal', '  (Applause', ')  In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President', '  Following NAFTA’s adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs', '  Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened', '  But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises', '  We did our job', '  (Applause', ')\n\nSix days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U', 'S', '-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law', '  The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers', '  (Applause', ')  It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity', '  We will have that: fairness and reciprocity', '  And I say that, finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThis is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of America’s jobs', '  Our strategy has worked', '  Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA', '  (Applause', ')\n\nFor decades, China has taken advantage of the United States', '  Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever had with China, including with President Xi', '  They respect what we’ve done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, “That’s enough', '”  (Applause', ')  Now we want to rebuild our country, and that’s exactly what we’re doing', '  We are rebuilding our country', '\n\nAs we restore — (applause) — American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere', '  (Applause', ')  That’s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy', '  The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro', '  (Applause', ')  Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people', '  But Maduro’s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken', '\n\nHere this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans', '  Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó', '  (Applause', ')  Mr', '

getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share', '  (Applause', ')  I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of Allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled', '\n\nAnd just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces', '  It’s called the Space Force', '  (Applause', ')  Very important', '\n\nIn the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman', '  And what he wants so badly — 13 years old — Iain Lanphier', '  He’s an eighth grader from Arizona', '  Iain, please stand up', '\n\nIain has always dreamed of going to space', '  He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy', '  He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force', '  As Iain says, “Most people look up at space', '  I want to look down on the world', '”  (Laughter and applause', ')\n\nBut sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all', '  Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago', '  Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen — the first black fighter pilots — and he also happens to be Iain’s great-grandfather', '  (Applause', ')  Incredible story', '\n\nAfter more than 130 combat missions in World War Two, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam', '  On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday', '  (Applause', ')  A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General', '  And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office', '  General McGee, our nation salutes you', '  Thank you, sir', '  (Applause', ')\n\nFrom the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future', '\n\nMembers of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people', '  (Applause', ')  The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country', '  We must always remember that our job is to put America first', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream', '  Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools', '  To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships', '  The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list', '\n\nOne of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia', '  Janiyah', '  (Applause', ')  Janiyah’s mom, Stephanie, is a single parent', '  She would do anything to give her daughter a better future', '  But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children', '\n\nJaniyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery', '  Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter', '  Thank you very much', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBut, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over', '  I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice', '  (Applause', ')\n\nNow I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received', '  Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act — because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school', '  (Applause', ')\n\nEvery young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow', '  For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the BE BEST initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation — online, in school, and in our communities', '  Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children', '  Thank you very much', '  (Applause', ')\n\nMy administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background', '  Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans', '\n\nMy budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation’s high schools', '  Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTo expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation’s historically black colleges and universities', '  (Applause', ')\n\nA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth', '  Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years', '  I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives', '  Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive — and better', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI’ve also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions', '  (Applause)', '  And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security', '  Always', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThe American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills', '  That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency', '  (Applause', ')  Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform', '  (Applause', ')  It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care', '\n\nBut as we work to improve Americans’ healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely', '\n\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans', '  To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOver 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders', '  These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration', '  That is what is happening in California and other states', '  Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money', '\n\nIf forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left', '  But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThis will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built', '  (Applause', ')  We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time', '  Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed', '\n\nMy administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies', '  We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before', '  (Applause', ')  And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAnd working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels', '  I’ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly', '  I’m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices', '  Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAUDIENCE:  H', 'R', '3', '  H', 'R', '3', '  H', 'R', '3', '\n\nWith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic', '  Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years', '  (Applause', ')  Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent — and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all', '  (Applause', ')\n\nProtecting Americans’ health also means fighting infectious diseases', '  We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China', '  My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat', '\n\nWe have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health', '  And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAlmost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness', '  Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis', '  This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet', '  Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAnd, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor', '  Please', '  (Applause', ')\n\n(The Medal of Freedom is presented', ')  (Applause', ')\n\nRush and Kathryn, congratulations', '  Thank you, Kathryn', '\n\nAs we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs', '  In 2017, doctors at St', ' Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive', '  Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter', '  Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life', '  Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery', '  Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight', '  (Applause', ')\n\nEllie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life', '  And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive', '  It’s an incredible thing', '  Thank you very much', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOur goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie', '  That is why I’m asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America’s youngest patients', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThat is why I’m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies', '  (Applause', ')  Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God', '\n\nAs we support America’s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country', '  (Applause', ')\n\nNow I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation', '  (Applause', ')\n\nForty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit', '  (Applause', ')  I’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether', '  (Applause', ')  And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality child care, and urge you to act immediately', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTo protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe must also rebuild America’s infrastructure', '  (Applause', ')  I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso’s highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land', '\n\nI’m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet, including and especially in rural America', '  (Applause', ')\n\nA better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe', '  That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation’s heroic ICE officers', '  (Applause', ')\n\nLast year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders', '\n\nTragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens', '\n\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed', '\n\nJust 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman', '  The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York’s sanctuary policies, he was set free', '  If the city had honored ICE’s detainer request, his victim would still be alive today', '\n\nThe state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants — a very terrible sanctuary — with catastrophic results', '\n\nHere is just one tragic example', '  In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault', '  But as required by California’s Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him', '\n\nDays later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence', '  He viciously shot one man going about his daily work', '  He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest', '  He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon', '  He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims', '  One of the victims is — a terrible, terrible situation; died — 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones', '\n\nRocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood', '  Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world', '  One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight', '  Jody, would you please stand', '  Jody, thank you', '  (Applause', ')  Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice', '\n\nSenator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices', '  (Applause', ')\n\nI ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately', '  The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers', '  And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe', '  My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBefore I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again', '  My administration has ended catch and release', '  (Applause', ')  If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country', '  (Applause', ')\n\nVery importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala', '  As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row', '  (Applause', ')  And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly', '\n\nLast year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz', '  Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants', '  Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight', '  Chief Ortiz, please stand', '  (Applause', ')  A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE', '  Thank you very much', '  Thank you', '  (Applause', ')\n\nTo build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWith every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom', ' (Applause', ')  Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — thank you, Mitch — (applause) — and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written', '  This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh', '  Thank you', '  (Applause', ')  And we have many in the pipeline', '  (Laughter and applause', ')\n\nMy administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools', '  (Applause', ')  In America, we don’t punish prayer', '  We don’t tear down crosses', '  We don’t ban symbols of faith', '  We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors', '  In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God', '\n\nJust as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country', '  So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation', '  Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars', '  I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts — (applause) — using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars', '  (Applause', ')\n\nMy administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism', '  (Applause', ')\n\nLast week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians', '  Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future', '\n\nThree years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria', '  Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS — the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi — is dead', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWe are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller', '  After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker', '  She once wrote, “Some people find God in church', '  Some people find God in nature', '  Some people find God in love', '  I find God in suffering', '  I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering', '”  In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself', '  After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla', '  She was just 26 years old', '\n\nOn the night that U', 'S', ' Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room', '  He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: “Task Force 8-14', '”  It was a reference to a special day: August 14th — Kayla’s birthday', '  Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla — and neither will we', '  Thank you', '  (Applause', ')\n\nEvery day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart', '\n\nOne of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake', '  On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage: “I will be with you again,” he wrote to Gage', '  “I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also', '  I love you son', '  Take care of your mother', '  I am always with you', '  Daddy', '”\n\nOn Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb', '  That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country', '  Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well', '  To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever', '  He is looking down on you now', '  Thank you', '  (Applause', ')  Thank you very much', '  Thank you both very much', '\n\nThe terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life', '  Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq', '  As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children', '  He directed the December assault and went on to assault U', 'S', ' forces in Iraq', '  Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard', '  And that’s why, last month, at my direction, the U', 'S', ' military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever', '  (Applause', ')\n\nOur message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice', '  If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life', '  (Applause', ')\n\nIn recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers', '  The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people', '\n\nBecause of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly', '  We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery', '  It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help', '  We are here', '  Let’s see which road they choose', '  It is totally up to them', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAs we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s wars in the Middle East', '\n\nIn Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway', '  I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent', '  It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies', '  These are warfighters that we have — the best in the world — and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all', '  We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home', '  (Applause', ')\n\nWar places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children — six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan', '  Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families', '  For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East', '  Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months', '  Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you', '  Thank you, Amy', '  (Applause', ')\n\nBut, Amy, there is one more thing', '  Tonight, we have a very special surprise', '  I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment', '  He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAUDIENCE:  USA',

greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life', '  This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur', '  This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more', '  This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley', '  This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo — (applause) — the beautiful, beautiful Alamo', '\n\nThe American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth', '  Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers', '  And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThis is our glorious and magnificent inheritance', '  We are Americans', '  We are pioneers', '  We are the pathfinders', '  We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God', '  (Applause', ')\n\nAmerica is the place where anything can happen', '  America is the place where anyone can rise', '  And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true', '\n\nThis nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece', '  We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored', '  Our brightest discoveries are not yet known', '  Our most thrilling stories are not yet told', '  Our grandest journeys are not yet made', '  The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun', '\n\nOur spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God’s grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come', '  (Applause', ')\n\nThank you', '  God
